Help me! I've been shot!\" and then named her killer with her dying breath.Shaken witnesses yesterday told a spellbound Houston courtroom how the blood-covered, mortally wounded 23-year-old Hispanic singing sensation burst into the lobby of the Corpus Christi Days Inn last March 31.Gasping for breath, Selena told motel workers that Yolanda Saldivar the president of her fan club shot her once in the back. She begged, \"Close the door or she will shoot me again,\" the witnesses said.The testimony came on the third day of Saldivar's trial on charges she murdered Selena with a shot from a .38-caliber revolver when the star tried to fire her for embezzling $30,000 from two boutiques she managed for the singer.As a paramedic and motel workers recounted Selena's last desperate moments, her mother, father and brother sobbed quietly. Saldivar, as she has throughout the trial, stared blankly.Ruben Deleon, the motel's sales director, said he knelt over the dying star and asked who shot her.\"She said 'Yolanda Saldivar in room 158,' \" Deleon said.\"She was yelling, 'Help me! Help me! I've been shot,' \" said Rosalinda Gonzalez, an assistant manager. \"I asked who shot her. She said the lady in room 158. She moaned. Her eyes rolled up.\"Front desk clerk Shawna Vela said she dialed 911 and took the phone with her as she kneeled over the fallen singer, asking her what happened.\"She said 'Yolanda,' she said 'In room 158,' \" Vela testified.The first paramedic on the scene, Richard Fredrickson, testified that he arrived just two minutes after the call but it was already too late.\"The girl was covered with blood,\" he remembered. \"Blood was thick from her neck to her knees, all the way around both sides.\"Fredrickson couldn't even see the mortal wound until he cut off Selena's sweatshirt. He felt for a pulse in her neck but could feel only twitching muscles, he said.Minutes later, as he rode in an ambulance with the now unconscious Selena, he unclenched the dying woman's fist and made an ironic discovery.\"When I opened it, a ring fell out,\" he said. \"It was covered with blood.\"The 14-karat gold and diamond ring, topped with a white-gold egg, was a gift from the Grammy winner's boutique employes and Saldivar. Police have said Saldivar demanded the ring back. But before Selena could hand it over, she was shot.The singer, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla Perez, was born around Easter and collected decorative eggs.The defense claims Saldivar, 35, was hysterical and shot Selena by accident. Prosecutors say it was deliberate.",

She said results will be shared with doctors in the United States, \"so everyone will be on the same page.\"\"Back at hotel now to chill out,\" Douceur wrote. She added, \"So nice to see green and smell freshly cut grass, flowers, birds chirping, insects, etc., since it's now been over a year on the flat polar plateau of just ice and snow.\" She landed in Christchurch on Monday.Douceur, 58, is a Seabrook, N.H., resident who worked as a manager for research station contractor Raytheon Polar Services Co. She asked for an emergency evacuation after having what doctors believed was a stroke in August, but officials rejected her request because of bad weather, saying that sending a rescue plane was too dangerous and that her condition wasn't life-threatening.Doctors she contacted for a second opinion say a tumor may have caused her vision and speech problems.After initially having half her field of vision vanish, Douceur said last week she can now read if she concentrates on just a few words at a time. She said she sometimes jumbles words and has had trouble remembering simple lists of words during medical evaluations.",

Nothing I could do about it but watch storm footage on CNN International while drinking non-alcoholic Budweiser (no booze in the kingdom) and listening to the sounds of the muzzein calling Muslims to worship at the mosque behind the Marriott.That was the same month that the financial crisis hit, and on the day of Lehman Brothers' ( LEHMQ - news - people ) collapse I spent the evening with billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal at his camp in the desert outside of Riyadh. We sat in the open air, under a starry sky, on an expanse of Persian rugs that must have taken up a quarter-acre. He was attended by a cadre of Bedouin servants who wore little pistols in their belts and continually refilled our little china cups with strong yellow Arabian coffee. A news junkie, the prince had three mega-screen TVs set up across the island of rugs from us. The biggest one in the middle was tuned to CNBC. The others showed pilgrims in Mecca walking around the Kaaba. It was the holy month of Ramadan. As we watched coverage of the financial collapse, Al-Waleed had the awesome idea of text-messaging CNBC's Maria Bartaromo his thoughts on Lehman. I think he was doing it mostly to show off that he had Maria's number in his phone, and I was impressed when she responded to his text 10 minutes later and asked him to be on her show the next day.Later in the evening I watched in disbelief as a line of about 500 Saudi men formed in the darkness, and one by one the men came forward to pay homage to the prince and ask him for some form of charity (money for a car, tuition, dowry, debts, etc). Several young men recited poems to the prince, who all the while continued to watch TV or check his phone. He holds court like this every week, giving away millions in patronage each year. The prince spends a lot of time in the desert and says he doesn't go to sleep until he sees the sky begin to brighten with dawn.A couple days later I found myself in the desert again, this time in the white-leather backseat of a 10-year-old Crown Victoria being driven the four hours from Riyadh to Damman, where I was to tour the headquarters of oil company Saudi Aramco. During Ramadan Saudis are barred from eating or drinking anything from sunup to sundown. But there was no prohibition on rock and roll; the driver, without comment, popped a cassette tape of Aerosmith's greatest hits into the stereo, and we screamed over the pristine blacktop at 90 miles an hour. Finally, when the red ball dipped under the desert horizon, my driver pulled into a truckstop (which, other than oilfield flares and a few camels, was the only sign of life in the desert) and bought us some snacks and water. I had been abstaining from food during the day as well, in part to see how the Saudis did it, and also because there was none for sale until nightfall. A few minutes later the driver pulled off the road to pray. I sat in the parked car and ate the most delicious bag of chips ever, all the while marveling that Aerosmith's \"Crazy\" was a much better song than I ever remembered.

        "text": "Dear TW: There are serious numerical anomalies in the debate you are moderating.You may want to check it out.I will state no opinion on who should or should not, will or will not become President of Mexico in four weeks\u00b4 time.I will nevertheless tell you that there is ample evidence to point out that the vote in this debate has been tampered with.I am sorry and certainly I believe the political operative who quite possibly has been behind this vote-rigging has to be at least privately reprimanded by his party;The Economist\u00b4s staff may want to do a quick investigation with the ample means at their disposal and should they conclude that enough evidence supports the proposition that this shameful event has taken place, a disclaimer on the debate should be added.Pulling this under the rug would be quite counter-productive.To many people the world over, myself included, this newspaper is an institution worth preserving.Numbers, facts and balanced, insightful analysis are the reasons we have trusted The Economist for decades. It is totally unacceptable for anyone to tarnish its reputation by using old Mexican small-town vote-rigging tactics either to get back at Mrs Josefina Vazquez\u00b4s use of The Economist at the first televised presidential debate against Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto, or as a propaganda tool in the next debate.Let\u00b4s see the numbers.For those unfamiliar with Mexico\u00b4s presidential election to be held July 1, 2012,there are four candidates.One of them, from the teacher\u00b4s union, has never polled above 5%.The ones with real chances are Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto from PRI, who polled formerly as high as 42% and now in the low 30s; Mrs.Josefina Vazquez, from the ruling center-right PAN,now in third and formerly in second place, polling in the high 20s, and Mr. AMLO from the center-left PRD, now in second place, polling in the low 30s but behind Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Some polls speak of a four point spread between the two, others point to a ten point spread.But the essence of the matter is that all parties as well as the voters they represent are united in this: they are all against PRI and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto ever claiming back the presidency they lost in the year 2000.Thus if Mr Pe\u00f1a Nieto has 34% or 42 % of the votes, by definition that means that either 66% or 58% of all voters are opposed to the proposition that \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your poll shows 30% of the people opposing your motion instead of the 60-70% indicated by all polls conducted in Mexico is a first sign of trouble.Only the staff at The Economist knows how many votes have originated outside Mexico.If the numbers do not change much once these non-Mexico originated votes have been removed, the idea of vote manipulation gathers strength.Now, the people most likely to read this newspaper in Mexico, and thus vote in your debate, are naturally highly educated professionals.But you see, the latest poll gruporeforma.blogs.com/encuestas confirms the well-known fact that this demographic is overwhelmingly against the PRI, and has been so for at least 20 years, if not more.The affluent and well-educated are mostly PRD and to a certain extend PAN.In Mexico City, for example, PRD has a twenty-point lead.The actual numbers nationwide are:For voters with only primary education PRI 41%,PRD 30%, PAN 25%.For voters with college education:PRI 28%, PRD 43%, PAN 21%.Therefore, among the people most likely to read TE less than 30% would agree with your proposition, yet your numbers show just the opposite result.Or do they? Well, actually the opinions stated in your 116 Opening Comments,50 Rebuttal Comments, 541 Opening Recommendations and 286 Rebuttal Recommendations if carefully tabulated and analyzed are totally supportive of those rough numbers of 70% of voter\u00b4s negating PRI\u00b4s returning to the Presidency and below 30% believing \"Mexico is better off under the PRI\" The fact that your comments are in statistical agreement with the numbers we would expect from a multitude of polls, while your poll debate numbers are so divergent as to be mirror images of the former is a clear indication of voter fraud.If we read carefully the 116 Opening Comments we see only 105 are real comments, since people sometimes mistakenly click on to post before they have actually written any comment.About 10% of these 105 indicate no decision on the debate\u00b4s proposition, but rather speak of various tangential matters such as the convenience for non-Mexicans to abstain from voting(the opinion of that gentleman who wisely retired to sunny Portugal,SaintMartinian),or to buy beach-front property(YukonDave),teachers saying they will use the debate in their classroom...and a funny Mexican who thinks his country would be better served if it were a colony of Sweden or The Netherlands(recommended by 3)...or another one who says Mexico would have been better off if it had not declared independence from Spain.",

Who questioned our resolve and our reach. But let us remind ourselves this is America. We rise to the challenge. We persevere.

Breathless stories have extolled the benefits of having all these tech-savvy, \"new economy\" companies move into a stretch of real estate that's been withering legitimate businesses for decades.It certainly seemed like a good opportunity to take a look at some of the businesses that have thrived in this neighborhood. And there are plenty of those - don't let those boarded-up windows fool you. Mid-Market and the Tenderloin are home to a thriving ecosystem of micro industries, and these entrepreneurs are in it for the long haul.\"Fenced goods dealers are all at the southwest corner of Market and Seventh,\" Deleano Seymour told me as we walked around the neighborhood.

The northeast corner of Market is pretty quiet, but farther down the block, between Seventh and Sixth, there's another, larger, group of young gentlemen who are usually there.\"Oh, that's weed,\" Seymour said. \"No hard drugs on Market. Just weed, stolen goods, and then the women who sell food stamps and USDA commodities. That's all that's on Mission, too. I'll show you the hard drug corners a little further up.\"Seymour has been mentioned in the pages of this newspaper as the guide for Tenderloin Walking Tours, an excellent tour he leads by appointment. He lived in the Tenderloin for 30 years, and lived it, as he told me, \"from every angle - from the highest heights to the gutter.\"Like many people who once lived on the wrong side of the law, Seymour has embraced the straight life with passion - moving to Nob Hill, wearing suits and hats no matter the occasion, offering reactionary opinions on illegal activity. (\"You want to get the drugs out of this neighborhood? All the dealers come from the East Bay. Just put the dogs on BART!\") But he hasn't forgotten his old friends now that he's gone straight. As we walk through the streets, he stops to embrace or speak to someone every few steps. He knows everyone here - and everything that's going on.\"Right now I'd say prescription drugs are the top seller on the street,\" he said. \"Those guys are making the most money right now.\"\"Those guys,\" in case you're wondering, can be found hustling their wares within the boundaries of Leavenworth, Turk, Jones and Golden Gate Avenue. They share this space with the heroin dealers, Seymour told me, but as businessmen have a fundamentally different approach.\"Prescription drug sellers are all about volume - they can make two or three thousand dollars a month selling their meds,\" he said as we walked through, watching them do just that. \"But heroin users are a smaller market, and they're very regimented people. So the sellers only come through twice a day, and they tend to sell to the same people for years. That industry is all about relationships.\"\"What about barriers to entry?\" I asked him. \"How hard is it to get a business started here?\"\"Not hard,\" he said. \"We don't have gangs in the Tenderloin, so there aren't the same battles over territory. You could set up shop right here and start selling.\"We were standing at the corner of Eddy and Jones, near the crack corners, right across the street from the Tenderloin Police Station.\"Really?\" I asked. \"I wouldn't have to worry about violence? About cops?\"\"Definitely not about cops,\" he said. \"But that's because everyone tries to keep the violence down. Violence is what brings the cops in, and that's bad for business. And violence happens when people try to move in on other people's customers. So in order to move here, you have to have your own customer base already.\"\"So you have to have a company brand already,\" I said.This all sounded pretty involved to me - and not like the sort of economic activity that could be easily uprooted by a few Internet companies. I asked Seymour whether he thought the new businesses would disrupt the current economic patterns of the neighborhood.\"No way,\" he said. \"But there's nothing for them to be worried about. Their hustle will be respected, the same as anyone else's.\"As long as the new arrivals respect the area's existing businesses, I imagine they'll have little to worry about. But it might take more than a few tax breaks and Twitter buses to bring the kind of change that City Hall is hoping to bring into Mid-Market.The technology industry is newer than the vice industry.

        "text": "Vaslav Nijinsky, the great Russian dancer who was driven from the stage by madness in 1917 at the peak of his fame, recorded his thoughts and ravings in the next two years in a diary that he signed ''God Nijinsky.''Although the diary was published in 1946 while Nijinsky was still alive, and the original handwritten volumes were sold at auction in 1979 for more than $100,000, a long-suppressed preface by the psychoanalyst Alfred Adler has now been printed for the first time, in The Archives of General Psychiatry.The preface is the only published first-hand professional opinion of Nijinsky, whose mental illness led to consultations with all the foremost experts of his day, including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Its publication was prevented by Nijinsky's wife, Romola, who is said to have found its clinical observations distasteful, objecting in particular to Adler's belief that Nijinsky's schizophrenia was rooted in a pathological sense of inferiority. She replaced the preface with one of her own, which glorified her husband.According to Heinz L. Ansbacher, professor of psychology emeritus at the University of Vermont and editor of many of Adler's works, the preface is of interest not only for what it reveals about Nijinsky but also for its concise presentation of Adler's theory of schizophrenia. Adler, who joined Freud and Jung as a prominent founder of psychoanalysis, eventually went his own way, forming a school of what he called individual psychology.Nijinsky realized Adler's hopes for him by apparently regaining his sanity by the time he died in England in 1950 of a kidney disorder. Adler wrote in the preface in 1936: ''When I visited him two years ago in a sanitorium, he was quiet, well-nourished and interested in his guests. But he did not speak and only occasionally broke into a friendly laugh. The attending physician informed me that this patient was always quiet and could not be forced to speak.''Mrs. Nijinsky, who had been married to the dancer since 1913, invited Adler to the sanitorium in Switzerland and later, because of his hopeful prognosis, she asked him to write the preface to the diary that she later found so distressing.Adler died in 1937, but his family kept the preface until 1973 before turning it over to Dr. Ansbacher. Mrs. Nijinsky, however, was still alive then and Dr. Ansbacher was asked by her agent not to make it public. Her death in Paris in 1978 freed him to seek publication. 'Badly Prepared for LifeAdler said in his preface that ''our poor hero,'' Nijinsky, possessed motor, auditory and visual abilities ''far above average.'' But the analyst wrote that Nijinsky had been ''badly prepared for life, burdened from childhood with highly strained expectations, lacking the ordinary course of education, and put automatically in a class of people whose better schooling and background made him feel slighted.''Adler believed schizophrenia grew out of an indulgence in frustrated vanity coupled with feelings of inferiority that made a person retreat from social life. He conceded that a genetic factor, perhaps some anomaly of brain structure, could explain why only certain individuals broke completely with reality. This appreciation of the possibility that physical and social causes may blend in schizophrenia is in line with most current thinking. Marked Lack of Social InterestNijinsky had shown certain ''prepsychotic'' signs in childhood, Adler said, including ''a marked lack of social interest.'' One biographer noted: ''As a boy Nijinksy never had friends. He was by nature a solitary creature.''When such an absence of normal personal interaction goes uncorrected, Adler maintained, the child ''expects that life will be filled with triumphs and be free of difficulties, that everything will be done for him by others, while he is striving energetically to surpass others.''''Hence, for a time,'' Adler said, ''the person may be extremely successful.'' Indeed, Nijinsky's dancing was legendary. ''Sooner or later,'' Adler continued, ''especially when confronted by the problems of social life, of occupation, and of love, such a person gains the impression that the environment is constantly attacking him. Not comprehending the situation, he experiences this as a repeated insult, is subjected to a series of shocks until finally his resistance is completely broken down.''He is not prepared for a solution of his problems that would require that he give up his asocial interest in himself and that he cooperate and contribute even when conditions are difficult and unfavorable to himself. Therefore, he cuts off his relations to the world of reality and, directed solely by his style of life, is guided by the fancies and imaginings of his childhood.''Wholly disillusioned and hopeless, he loses the remainder of his activity, which was diminished from the beginning, and turns more and more towards his 'irrational' imagination.''In the final paragraph of the preface, however, Adler said that restoring hope was a path to cure. Adler never actually treated Nijinsky, although he was begged to take the case. ''If I had had time enough,'' Adler said, ''I think I could have helped him.''The preface made no mention of the dancer's wife. This omission, according to Dr. Ansbacher, was unusual for Adler, who always considered a patient's social context.The diary itself made repeated negative references to her. She Stayed With HimMrs. Nijinsky reported ''periods of violence'' between Nijinsky and herself, but she stayed with him against all advice to get a divorce. Dr. Ansbacher said, ''Romola's goal from the start was to become known as the faithful wife of the great Nijinsky, a goal for which she was willing to pay any price and which she indeed attained.''And yet her ''mythologizing'' as Dr. Ansbacher called it, ''did not preclude good practical sense.'' She was quick to notice what conditions seemed to improve her husband and eventually helped him regain his independence and sanity.There were two steps to recovery in Nijinsky's case, as summarized by Dr. Ansbacher. In 1938 he was among the first psychiatric patients to receive insulin coma therapy, a shock treatment, which freed him of his hallucinations and enabled him to live outside the hospital, although still requiring his wife's constant care.Then in 1945, when the Russians occupied the town in Hungary where the Nijinskys were living, he began to speak to the Russian soldiers and even, one night, to jump up and dance spontaneously with them as they performed peasant dances.Dr. Ansbacher characterized this experience as ''milieu therapy'' of the type practiced today in rehabilitating schizophrenic patients. Beyond these elements, and despite the tension in the marriage, Nijinsky also had his wife's support. ''When she decided to stay with Vaslav rather than abandon him to an asylum,'' Dr. Ansbacher concluded, ''this was an act of hope that must also have communicated itself to Vaslav. Without this basic hope, Vaslav would not have met the later opportunites.''Illustrations: photo of Vaslav Nijinsky (Page A9) Photo of Alfred Adler (Page A9)",

The preface is the only published first-hand professional opinion of Nijinsky, whose mental illness led to consultations with all the foremost experts of his day, including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  Its publication was prevented by Nijinsky's wife, Romola, who is said to have found its clinical observations distasteful, objecting in particular to Adler's belief that Nijinsky's schizophrenia was rooted in a pathological sense of inferiority. She replaced the preface with one of her own, which glorified her husband."

        "text": "Castao, who leads the Colombian paramilitaries, known by their Spanish acronym AUC, the largest right-wing paramilitary force to ever exist in the western hemisphere reveals that he was trained in the arts of war in Israelas a young man of 18 in the 1980s.He glowingly adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI copied the concept of paramilitary forces from the Israelis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his chapter-long account of his Israel experiences.Castao\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-wing Phalange-like AUC force is now by far the worst human rights violator in all of the Americas, and ties between that organisation and Israel are continually surfacing in the press.The AUC paramilitaries are a fighting force that originally grew out of killers hired to protect drug-running operations and large landowners. They were organised into a cohesive force by Castao in 1997. It exists outside the law but often coordinates its actions with the Colombian military, in a way similar to the relationship of the Lebanese Phalange to the Israeli army throughout the 1980s and 1990s.According to a 1989 Colombian Secret Police intelligence report, apart from training Carlos Castao in 1983, Israeli trainers arrived in Colombia in 1987 to train him and other paramilitaries who would later make up the AUC.Fifty of the paramilitaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest\u00e2\u0080\u009d students were then sent on scholarships to Israel for further training according to a Colombian police intelligence report, and the AUC became the most prominent paramilitary force in the hemisphere, with some 10,000-12,000 men in arms.The Colombian AUC paramilitaries are always in need of arms, and it should come as no surprise that some of their major suppliers are Israeli. Israeli arms dealers have long had a presence in next-door Panama and especially in Guatemala.In May of last year, GIRSA, an Israeli company associated with the Israeli Defence Forces and based in Guatemala was able to buy 3000 Kalashnikov assault rifles and 2.5 million rounds of ammunition that were then handed over to AUC paramilitaries in Colombia.Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military relations with right-wing groups and regimes spans Latin America from Mexico to the southernmost tip of Chile, starting just a few years after the Israeli state came into existence.Since then, the list of countries Israel has supplied, trained and advised includes Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela.But it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only the sales of planes, guns and weapons system deals that characterises the Israeli presence in Latin America.Where Israel has excelled is in advising, training and running intelligence and counter-insurgency operations in the Latin American \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty war\u00e2\u0080\u009d civil conflicts of Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and now Colombia.In the case of the Salvadoran conflict - a civil war between the right-wing landowning class supported by a particularly violent military pitted against left-wing popular organisations - the Israelis were present from the beginning. Besides arms sales, they helped train ANSESAL, the secret police who were later to form the framework of the infamous death squads that would kill tens of thousands of mostly civilian activists.From 1975 to 1979, 83% of El Salvador's military imports came from Israel, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. By 1981, many of those in the civilian popular political movements who had survived the death squads headed for the hills to become guerrillas.By 1981 there was an open civil war in El Salvador which took over a decade to resolve through negotiations.Even though the US was openly backing the Salvadoran Army by 1981, as late as November 1983 it was asking for more Israeli \u00e2\u0080\u009cpractical assistance\u00e2\u0080\u009d there, according to a declassified secret document obtained recently by Aljazeera.Among the assistance asked for were helicopters, trucks, rifles, ammunition, and combat infantry advisors to work at both the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccompany and battalion level of the Salvadoran Army\u00e2\u0080\u009d.One notable Salvadoran officer trained by the Israelis was Major Roberto D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubuisson, who always held a high opinion of the Israelis. It was Major D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubuisson who ordered the assassination of El Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s archbishop amongst thousands of other murders.Later he would organise the right-wing National Republican Alliance Party (ARENA) and send his son to study abroad in the relative safety of Israel.Amazingly, while the Israelis were training the El Salvadoran death squads they were also supporting the anti-semitic Argentine military government of the late 1970s and early 1980s - at a time when that government was involvedin another \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty war\u00e2\u0080\u009d of death squads and disappearances.In 1978, Nicaragua\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dictator Somoza was making his last stand against a general uprising of the Sandinista-led population who were sick of his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynasty which had ruled and monopolised the county for half a century. The Israelis and the US had been supplying Somoza with weapons for years. But when President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1976 he ordered a cessation of all US military assistance to Nicaragua.Israel utilised Carter's humanrights policy to its advantageFilling the void, the Israelis immediately increased their weapons supplies to Somoza until he fled the country when the Sandinistas took power.Israeli operatives then helped train right-wing Nicaraguan Contras in Honduran and Costa Rican camps to fight the Sandinista government, according to Colombian police intelligence reports Aljazeerahas obtained.At least some of the same Israeli operatives had also previously trained the nucleus of the paramilitary organisations that would become the AUC in Colombia.But by far the bloodiest case of Israeli involvement in Latin America was its involvement in Guatemala from the 1970s to the 1990s. As in El Salvador, a civil war pitted a populist but, in this case, mainly Indian left against a mainly European oligarchy protected by a brutal Mestizo Army.As Guatemalan President Carlos Arana said in 1971, \"If it is necessary to turn the country into a cemetery in order to pacify it, I will not hesitate to do so.\"The Israelis supplied Guatemala with Galil rifles, and built an ammunition factory for them, as well as supplying armoured personnel carriers and Arava planes. Behind the scenes, they were actively involved in the bloodiest counter-insurgency campaign the hemisphere has known since the European conquest, in which at least 200,000 (mostly Indians) were killed.Like Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original occupation of Palestine, several entire Guatemalan Indian villages were razed and a million people displaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe guerrilla is the fish. The people are the sea. If you cannot catch the fish, you have to drain the sea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Guatemalan President Rios Montt in 1982.Israeli arms and training fuelledGuatemalan unrestGuatemalan army officers credit Israeli support with turning the tide against the uprising, not only in the countryside where Israeli counter-insurgency techniques and assistance set up strategic-hamlet-like \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevelopment poles\u00e2\u0080\u009d along the lines of the Israeli kibbutz, but also in the cities where \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsraeli communication technicians and instructors\u00e2\u0080\u009d working through then-sophisticated computers were able to locate and then decimate guerrillas and their supporters in Guatemala City in 1981.From the late 1970s until the 1990s, the US could not overtly support the Guatemalan army because of its horrendous human rights record (although there was some covert support), but many in the US government, especially in the CIA, supported Israel in taking up the slack.But the US grew to regret its actions. On 10 March 1999, US President Bill Clinton issued an apology for US involvement in the war: The \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnited States... support for military forces or intelligence units which engaged in violent and widespread repression...was wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No similar statement has ever been forthcoming from the Israelis.At the present time, the only major insurgency war in Latin America is in Colombia, where Israel has an overt involvement.Besides the dozen or so Kfir IAI C-7 jet fighters they have sold the Colombian government, and the Galil rifles produced in Bogota under licence, most of the Israeli ties to the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counter-insurgency war are closely-guarded secrets.Aljazeera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts to obtain clarification on these and other issues for this story were stonewalled by the Israeli embassy in Washington.Why does Israel continue to provide arms and expertise to the pariahs of the world? Clearly, part of the reason is the revenues produced by arms sales, and part of it has do with keeping up with trends in counter-insurgent war across the globe.But another factor is what is demanded of Israel by the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only superpower, the US, in partial exchange for the superpower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued support for Israeli dominance in the Middle East.This relationship can be best illustrated by recently declassified 1983 US government documents obtained by the Washington, DC-based National Security Archives through the Freedom of Information Act.One such declassified document is a 1983 memo from the notorious Colonel Oliver North of the Reagan Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Council and reads: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs discussed with you yesterday, I asked CIA, Defense, and State to suggest practical assistance which the Israelis might offer in Guatemala and El Salvador.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnother document, this time a 1983 cable from the US Ambassador in Guatemala to Washington Frederic Chapin shows the money trail.He says that at a time when the US did not want to be seen directly assisting Guatemala, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have reason to believe that our good friends the Israelis are prepared, or already have, offered substantial amounts of military equipment to the GOG (Government of Guatemala) on credit terms up to 20 years...(I pass over the importance of making huge concessionary loans to Israel so that it can make term loans in our own backyard).\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn other words, during civil wars in which the US does not want to be seen getting its hands dirty in Latin America, the superpower loans Israel money at a very good rate, and then Israel uses these funds to do the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirty work\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In this regard, in Latin America at least, Israel has become the hit-man for the US.",

But that was more than 30 years ago.When it came time to start college planning for his daughter, Anya, 17, there was never any question about setting aside money to prepare her for the standardized test that most colleges use in evaluating applicants.He suggested a tutor through Kaplan Test Prep, said Anya, who lives in Harlem and is an A student at Marymount School on the Upper East Side.Anya's two-year bill for SAT tutoring and other college test prep and coaching came to $4,500. The payoff for the high school senior who plans to apply to Ivy League schools this fall: A stellar score of 2,320 out of the new maximum of 2,400. That bettered her PSAT score by 100 points.\"This was a great investment,\" said Alex Havriliak, 49, who's chief financial officer of Volunteers of America in Manhattan.With competition fierce and with more students than ever taking the SAT \u2014 1.5 million kids took it in the last school year, a nearly 30% jump from 10 years ago, according to the College Board \u2014 paying for study help has increasingly become a must.For parents of high school juniors who want their kids to take the exams next spring, now's the time to start planning.But in the midst of assessing the heavy costs of college, many parents often forget the expense of test prep.\"Families need to budget early for this,\" said Katherine Cohen, CEO of applywise.com, a Manhattan-based online college admissions counselor.There are a number of prep options at a wide range of price points. Study aids run the gamut from $399 online classes to qualified, one-on-one tutors who charge anywhere from $150 to $750 an hour.The most popular form of test prep are classroom courses, although the fastest growing option is one-on-one tutoring. Classes generally cost about $1,000 and include around 30 hours of teaching as well as practice exams that simulate the real test experience. Students also supplement course work with products like $4.99 SAT prep iPod downloads and $20 shower curtains featuring the top 500 SAT words. Last year, Kaplan began selling $9.99 comic books where the characters use the most frequently tested words.Despite the huge growth in prep, the College Board \u2014 which owns the three-hour-and-45-minute, three-part exam that tests math, reading and writing \u2014 insists the exam gauges what you learned in high school, not fancy tricks taught by experts.\"The best preparation is studying hard in school,\" said Laurence Bunin, senior vice president of the SAT program for the College Board. \"Short-term expensive prep courses do not result in score gains,\" he said.",

For 18 months, Callie Shell has enjoyed intimate access to the man who would be the 44th president of the United States of America - and the first black occupant of the White House. Shell has been there to capture the down moments, the nerves and weariness of Barack Obama on her camera - seen in this selection of her photographs.With exclusive access to the \"Change\" campaign, she eats, sleeps, travels and lives with her subjects. \"I like to be forgotten,\" she says. \"Then I can document their lives.\" But criss-crossing America, Shell has cultivated a unique relationship with Obama. During the New Hampshire primary in January, Obama turned to his wife Michelle on the campaign bus and said: \"The reason why Callie and I get along so well is because we've both got big ears.\" Michelle turned to Shell and said: \"Isn't it amazing he ever got a wife?\"The pair have covered thousands of miles on the road together. \"We do get along well,\" says Shell. \"He's good-looking, funny and smart.\" Watching him working on a speech, his feet up on a table, Shell was amazed to notice that Obama's shoes had two large holes, one in each sole. \"I'm not giving them up,\" he said. \"I've broken them in and they're not ready to go yet.\" Obama is superstitious like that, she says. She has seen him make speeches with his pockets full of lucky charms given by supporters. And he keeps routines. Obama, his staff, security and Shell all rise at 6am and do not go to bed until midnight. He manages to sleep only by catching brief cat-naps, which Shell insists on photographing. Obama dislikes the results, but she thinks it is important that people see he often does not sleep in a proper bed.Shell, a 47-year-old from Georgia, was Al Gore's photographer for eight years when he was Bill Clinton's vice-president. \"Gore didn't trust me at first - it took him about a year. He was hard, but Obama's easy.\" One of Shell's favourite pictures on the campaign bus is of Michelle falling asleep on Barack's shoulder while he is mid-text-message. She also captured the pair standing in a corridor, their heads touching, seizing a rare moment alone.The first time Shell photographed Obama with his family was in November 2006 before he had decided, officially, to run for the White House. Shell describes the scene: \"I'm in his kitchen, he's helping the girls get ready for school, he's about to leave for the office and Michelle's going to leave for the university.

        "text": "A detail from Saying Farewell at Xunyang, by Qiu Ying, c1500-50 Photograph: John Lamberton/Nelson-Atkins Museum of ArtOn 5 August 1473, a young artist drew the first ever landscape. The date is known precisely because Leonardo da Vinci wrote it on the sheet of paper, as if aware of the revolutionary nature of what he was doing. To look at mountains and trees just for themselves was unprecedented.Or was it? The invention of landscape painting is one of the great moments of European art. Painting nature is a way to get inside yourself. To this day, people enjoy doing watercolours in the outdoors as a form of meditation. Leonardo's discovery of the mystery of nature \u2013 which you see in all his paintings, with their dreamy rocks and pools \u2013 is the invention of a new kind of inner life.Yet it is a lot less original than we might like to think. There is an uncanny likeness between Leonardo's rocks, trees and rivers and the rocks, trees and rivers that Chinese artists were painting centuries before he was born. It is bizarre: that 1473 drawing actually looks like a reworking of classic Chinese paintings such as Li Gongnian's Winter Evening Landscape. When was that painted? I look at the label in the V&A's new exhibition Masterpieces of Chinese Painting. It says 1120. That's 353 years before the very similar sketch by Leonardo.It is conventional, nowadays, to pay lip service to the fact that many versions of art exist, that beautiful art comes from all over the world and every way of life. Yet the story of art that most of us absorb \u2013 as told in The Story of Art by EH Gombrich, first published in 1950 and still the definitive account of art's progress \u2013 puts European innovation at the centre of the action. All peoples make art, but the west takes it forward.Masterpieces of Chinese Painting is the most devastating refutation of such assumptions I have ever seen. It shows that during the Song dynasty, at a time when Europeans were fighting barbaric crusades and had long forgotten the creativity that flourished in ancient Greece, artists in China were taking painting to heights of sensitivity and poetry that would not be attained elsewhere until the ages of Leonardo \u2013 or for that matter, when you look at the most radical Chinese touches, Van Gogh.I'd go further. Looking at this show being installed and talking to its curator Zhang Hongxing, I can't resist airing the theory that Leonardo stole the idea of landscape painting from China. Could he somehow have seen Chinese paintings? Might something have reached the west along the Silk Road? Excitedly, I get Leonardo's 1473 drawing up on my iPad and hold it among the 12th-century Chinese landscapes for comparison. The shapes of the hills and trees in Leonardo's sketch perfectly mirror the sugar-loaf peaks and willowy trees in 900-year-old Chinese paintings.Zhang's well aware of this idea: it was raised very seriously in the 1950s, he says, but there is no proof. It's a mystery. Nor is Leonardo the only European pioneer of landscape who looks \"Chinese\". Zhang points out that Pieter Bruegel the Elder is also very \"Chinese\" looking. This is true. Bruegel's much-loved Hunters in the Snow has all the elements that delighted medieval Chinese landscape painters, including all that snow.But why did China invent landscape art in the first place? Why did artists begin to depict, not gods and battles as elsewhere, but the grandeur of nature? It has something to do with Buddhism, which spread to China before AD1,000 and inspired a culture of contemplation. It also has to do with the technical achievements of the Song era. The scientific mind that perfected porcelain also looked at nature with a new clarity.One of the first things you see in the show was actually painted by a Song emperor \u2013 though it comes with a warning to rulers, for Emperor Huizong's dreamy fascination with art helped to lose him his throne. Indeed, as the curator explains, painting in China has always been associated with retreat and escapism. Not all the works in this exhibition are landscapes. There are pictures of courtesans and the tremendous Nine Dragons, a dazzling mythic vision painted by Chen Rong in 1244. Yet for me, the escapist pursuit of pastoral in China's pioneering landscapes is utterly beguiling. After the Mongols conquered China there was a clear association of art with the rejection of power. Turning their backs on the court, intellectuals created gardens, wrote poetry and painted expressive scenes of wintry trees. They rendered nature in a free, subjective style that anticipated \u2013 and of course, influenced \u2013 Van Gogh.Personally, I am convinced that Leonardo must have got access to the art of China. He was fascinated by the east and once applied for a job in Istanbul, offering to serve the Ottoman empire and praising Allah in a letter that survives. Did all this interest in Asia lead him to some hushed library where he unrolled a silk scroll and saw mountains, cherry blossoms and water?One thing is certain. Zhang's great exhibition turns the story of art upside down.",

        "text": "On a recent morning, New Line Cinema bosses Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne sat in their offices on Seventh Ave. looking over audience research on their mega movie \"The Lord of the Rings,\" which opens Wednesday. \"It has incredible awareness,\" Lynne said, jumping up from his seat. \"This is the moment before something very incredible can happen.\" \"I tend to be conservative,\" Shaye said more hesitantly. \"With some guardedness - I am very enthusiastic.\" It's hard to believe this is the same duo that within the last year has faced enough drama to transfix a movie audience, because of expensive flops like the Adam Sandler comedy \"Little Nicky\" and the Warren Beatty fiasco \"Town and Country,\" each of which cost $90 million. The Sandler film took in barely $60 million and the Beatty flick took in just $15 million at the box office. But with the debut of the movie version of J.R. Tolkien's epic saga of good and evil, the AOL Time Warner-owned studio that's been looking dumb and dumber lately has a shot at capturing the ring again. In their riskiest move to date and marking a first for Hollywood, Shaye and Lynne made three \"Lord of the Rings\" movies at once, pouring more than $270 million into a trilogy of special-effects-propelled films detailing the hobbits, dwarfs, humans, and elves of Middle-earth. The second \"Rings\" will come out next Christmas followed by the third installment a year later. Lynne and Shaye shot all three simultaneously to save on production costs, while locking in the \"Rings\" cast which includes Liv Tyler, Ian McKellan and Elijah Woods as the heroic Hobbit Frodo Baggins. The super-gamble comes at a tough time for New Line, the edgy, 35-year-old studio, founded in a lower Manhattan walk-up, that became known for turning less than sure thing projects into huge hits, like the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series and \"Dumb and Dumber.\" AOL Time Warner, which also owns the far bigger Warner Bros. movie studio - now flying high on \"Harry Potter\" and \"Ocean's Eleven\" - came down hard on Shaye and Lynne after their recent flops. This year the studio was forced to cut 20% of its staff and slash production budgets, while Shaye parted ways with one of his closest confidants, brash New Line production chief Mike DeLuca. To satisfy AOL Time Warner number crunchers, Shaye and Lynne have substantially reduced the financial downside on \"Rings.\" Through partnerships with foreign distributors, licensing agreements with companies like Burger King and JVC Electronics and tax incentives from New Zealand where the movies were shot, New Line has covered nearly 80% of the trilogy's productions costs. With pressure building on the studio, Hollywood cynics have linked New Line's very future to the success of the first \"Rings\" movie. \"AOL Time Warner is very large, the question is: Do they need another studio that makes lots of little films?\" said CIBC Oppenheimer media analyst John Corcoran. Shaye and Lynne's answer could very well be \"Rings.\" Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. \"Awareness is at big blockbuster status,\" said New Line president of marketing Russell Schwartz. The most crucial review so far has come from AOL Time Warner's newly named CEO, Dick Parsons, who told the Daily News that New Line's future was in no way tied to how well \"Rings\" performs at the box office. \"A studio doesn't hang in the balance on one film,\" Parsons said. But he didn't let New Line off easily: \"It wouldn't be good for AOL Time Warner if 'Lord of the Rings' isn't the success we think it is,\" he said. Parsons said New Line serves an important function as a source of movies to fill up AOL Time Warner's entertainment cable networks - TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies. While Parsons said he didn't expect \"Lord of the Rings\" to match \"Harry Potter's\" record breaking opening weekend, he said in the long run, \"Rings\" could be just as big as the boy wizard flick. \"I check my own sources - plain old New Yorkers,\" Parsons said, citing waiters, elevator operators, and his driver. \"They are telling me it will be huge.\" \"The momentum is growing stronger and stronger,\" agreed Gitesh Pandya, editor of Boxofficeguru.com. If \"Rings\" works, it would mean that once again New Line founder Shaye has proven he can defy the conventional wisdom in Hollywood. Over the years, he's backed risky projects and untested stars - like comic Jim Carrey before he became a superstar and now \"Rings\" director Peter Jackson. He locked in audiences with franchises like \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"Austin Powers,\" and \"Rush Hour.\" Up next for New Line: a third \"Austin Powers\" and \"I Am Sam,\" a drama starring Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer. Shaye's renegade style caught the eye of Ted Turner who bought the independent film studio in 1993. Turner's own empire was acquired by Time Warner, which was later sold to AOL. A lawyer turned filmmaker, Shaye, 62, started out in the business in 1967 peddling B movies like \"Reefer Madness\" on college campuses. Lynne, 60, met Shaye at Columbia Law School and joined New Line in 1990. The recent tough times have clearly taken a toll on Shaye who remains passionate about running the studio - even under demanding corporate parent AOL Time Warner. \"This business is creative. The process is daunting,\" Shaye said. \"You can't get it right every time.",

This is the conversion of the oil tanks of the former Bankside power station in London \u2013 a clover of three buried concrete cylinders \u2013 into new spaces for performance and exhibition for Tate Modern, which is what the power station became in 2000.This project is by the Basel-based firm of Herzog & de Meuron, architects of that icon of icons, the stadium built for the 2008 Beijing Olympics \u2013 or Bird's Nest, as the architects don't like it to be called. The stadium set out to be a modern Eiffel Tower and succeeded, impressing its image on global television audiences of billions: of all the attention-seeking buildings of recent years, it commanded as much attention as any.The Tanks at Tate Modern are a work of uncovering as much as addition, and finding rather than making, and there is not much chance that they will imprint their image on the world's imagination. You may indeed not be overwhelmingly excited by the photographs on this page, as the Tanks are hard to capture with a lens. They are voids rather than objects, things to be experienced rather than seen.They are not, however, exactly modest. Each has a height of 7 metres and a diameter of 30 metres. Built to hold the fuel that powered the turbines that generated electricity for a large chunk of the capital, and to withstand the risk of explosion, they are thick-walled and capacious, a trefoil of inside-out towers, or a castle in negative.They have the confident geometry of things made not for appearance but for a substantial practical use, and their concrete surfaces have a raw force. They are impressive just for being there, and the architects' approach has been largely to let their size and mass speak for themselves.One cylinder has been made into a performance space, another into a room for temporary installations with a preference for those using moving images. The third tank has been subdivided into the functions, such as dressing rooms, needed to serve the other two. Floors, ceiling and lighting have been added as necessary to fulfil their new tasks. On the approach to the Tanks you see an archaeology of patches and slatherings of concrete, marks of the changes and repairs made to the structure over the years.Unless you are a connoisseur of concrete techniques during the second Elizabethan era, you don't greatly distinguish between the changes made this year and those of a half-century ago. As in Astley Castle in Warwickshire, you're presented with a composite of past and present, where the joins between the two are not strongly marked. For an architect on such projects, according to Pierre de Meuron, \"it is mostly good advice to disappear, as you leave your traces anyway. It looks as if it has been so forever but it was actually different before.\" The urge to dramatise what is already impressive has been avoided.Rooflights could have been added, such that daylight could have gushed into the Tanks and made them into romantic Piranesian ruins, but Jacques Herzog says this \"would have been a trap \u2013 it becomes kitsch if you make too much of it\". The way that he and de Meuron have designed it is to stress that \"it is really an underground space\". Each tank has \"a door and that's it. It's just very straightforward.\"The effect of this approach is to flatten the experience of the Tanks, such that their scale grows on you rather than amazes you all at once.It also allows them to function as background to the performances and installations they will hold, rather than be the star turn in themselves. They will only be completed by the things that will happen in them, which is as it should be. And if you want drama there is no shortage of it in the Turbine Hall next door, or in a multi-storey twisted brick pyramid that is about to rise over the Tanks.It's tempting to see the fondness of digging and revealing as a sign of our less shiny times, and it can also be seen in the same architects' Serpentine Pavilion, and their plans for renovating the giant Park Avenue Armory in New York, but as the Tanks and the pyramid together will cost \u00a3215m, this new modesty would have to be taken at a purely symbolic level. It would be more accurate to see it as a continuation of the original idea of 1994, when it was first decided to make an old power station into the Tate's new gallery of modern art.The plan was derided at the time, as a backward-looking, heritage-obsessed failure to take the opportunity to commission proud new buildings, but the success of the Turbine Hall showed that it can be as powerful to use and modify found spaces as make new ones. The Tanks, meanwhile, remained a great secret place, buried beneath the grass behind Tate Modern. It was a particular obsession of Tate's director Nick Serota (who liked, evidently, to park his tanks under the lawn) to bring them into use.\"I want those oil tanks,\" he told his architects, \"even if I don't know how to use them,\" and eventually art based on performance and moving images provided the reason, and Tate's genius for fundraising came up with the cash. And so an intriguing new republic has been added to Tate's imperium, or a new district to its city of art. Visitors will now have a reason to turn right after passing through Tate Modern's main entrance, where at the moment all the interest is on the left.There is an obvious danger in pursuing space for its own sake, which is that whatever goes in it feels like a pretext, a token gesture embarrassed by its setting. There is also a danger that Tate's relentless expansion will bloat it, and make it in the end an exhausting barrage of over-spectacular presentations. With an exhibition area of 1,800 sq metres, the Tanks are more than half as big as the not-small Turbine Hall, and exceed the display space of entire regional galleries, such as the Turner Contemporary in Margate.But at this point, not yet tested by use, the Tanks feel credible.There seems to be a purpose to their intended programming with film and performance, and they are distinctive enough \u2013 exceptionally so \u2013 to be rather more than another dollop of space in the Tate's halls. In the end, these underground chambers are simply extraordinary places, of a kind that would not now be invented from scratch. It would have been a shocking not to make use of them.The Tanks at Tate Modern, London SE1 open on 18 July with Art in Action, a 15-week festival of performance and installation art",

In both movies, Barrymore\u2019s cuteness was an effective counterbalance (or complement) to Sandler\u2019s hodgepodge of crass loopiness and underlying sincerity.They\u2019re back together in \u201cBlended,\u201d as melancholy single parents whose families bond on an African vacation. Barrymore plays harried for a chunk of the story, reminding us that she\u2019s a mom in real life now, after all. But the movie could use a lot more of her familiar infectiousness. It\u2019s the glue that holds together Sandler\u2019s earnest moments and his penchant for scattershot tomfoolery.The story opens with Sandler\u2019s Jim and Barrymore\u2019s Lauren on, yes, a first date \u2014 a disastrous rendezvous punctuated by peeved barbs and \u201cemergency\u201d calls from home giving them a quick out. It\u2019s soon clear why they\u2019re both off their dating game: Lauren has a couple of unruly boys and a smugly useless ex (Joel McHale), while widowed Jim tries hard with his three girls, but is better at teaching them basketball than at helping them navigate puberty.A contrived coincidence involving Lauren\u2019s brassy friend (Wendi McLendon-Covey) gives both Jim and Lauren the opportunity to jump on a family trip to Africa for cheap. The two are irked to meet again, but gradually, each fills a void in the other\u2019s brood. Lauren is great with lullabies, and rightly points out that Jim\u2019s oldest daughter (Bella Thorne) might prefer something girlier than the barbershop haircuts he gets her. (Uncomfortable tomboy jokes are only made odder by Thorne\u2019s resemblance to Keira Knightley.) Jim, meanwhile, knows just what Lauren\u2019s younger boy (Kyle Red Silverstein) needs: a father figure who actually cares. Enough, even, to join him in cartoonish craziness like ostrich riding.\u201cYou gotta show up for your kids,\u201d Jim tells Lauren in a likably sentimental bit of parental philosophizing. Of course, this being an Adam Sandler movie, he and director pal Frank Coraci (\u201cWedding Singer,\u201d \u201cClick\u201d) hedge their narrative bets by glopping on the anything-goes humor that fans expect.Some of it works. Sandler and Barrymore have some great interaction with Alyvia Alyn Lind, who plays Jim\u2019s youngest daughter with a very funny mouths-of-babes streak. But while a Greek chorus styled like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and led by preening Terry Crews is gleefully wacky, don\u2019t be surprised if the caricatured African setting draws some complaints. The location feels more like a random choice than a thematically relevant one, and at times it plays like an ad for South Africa\u2019s infamously segregated Sun City resort.Funny thing, though: The sunnier that Barrymore gets in her scenes with Sandler, the more the iffy elements and leaden bits seem to just melt away. Blend in more of that spirit, and their latest pairing might rate better.",

Will the symbolism-minded Weiner show these people rising to a higher floor, elevator-style; tumbling in free-fall like the cartoon man in the title sequence; or going up and down and round and round \u201con a carousel\u201d?At the end of the first half of season seven last week, all signs pointed to a happy ending, to the tune of \u201cThe Best Things in Life Are Free.\u201d Yes, \u201cMad Men\u201d and a happy ending, a somewhat oxymoronic pairing. The show has been a long, slow slide into the darkest corners of its characters\u2019 personalities: Betty\u2019s childlike despair, Peggy\u2019s loneliness, Roger\u2019s nihilism, Joan\u2019s low self-image, and, of course, Don\u2019s self-loathing and identity theft. The sustained mood of the series has been one of simmering discontent and alcoholic numbness, with Don dragging everyone in his life into disappointment. And yet there we were in the midseason finale, a song-and-dance step away from peace and love.Don\u2019s shift was profound. Every season has been a study in how Don\u2019s poor, unstable childhood has played out unconsciously in his adult life. We\u2019ve seen him try to remake himself into a power broker with a suburban family, to lead the picture-perfect life \u2014 and yet succumb to his neurotic needs over and over again, creating lots of collateral damage in the process. Just when we\u2019d think he had to change or lose everything, we\u2019d join the long queue of those frustrated by Don as he undermined himself once more with a vengeance.But across the last half-season, Don seems to have become more self-aware. His lovely, platonic conversation on the plane with Neve Campbell in the first episode, the way he mentored Peggy into taking charge of the Burger Chef presentation and then proudly watched her succeed, his bittersweet acceptance when Megan broke up with him \u2014 all these moments indicated a newfound groundedness. He has hit rock bottom a number of times, but he no longer appears absolutely destined to do it again. Weiner even put Don in a somewhat saccharine scene in the penultimate episode \u2014 the dance to \u201cMy Way\u201d with Peggy \u2014 and it felt like a sentimental resolution more than a setup for another fall.The agency realignment led by Roger in order to save Don\u2019s job was another sign of warmth in the last episode, the kind of giddy business chess game that has become a staple of \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d Jim Cutler emerged as Don\u2019s enemy more than ever, openly struggling to fire him, but Weiner was not inviting us to take Jim\u2019s side. Roger, the quip-slinging hedonist once so passive about Don, became the rescuer, taking matters into his own hands as if to contradict Bert\u2019s comment that he was not a leader. The day was saved for Don, quite a victory given his non grata status at the end of season six.The uniting factor in the last episode also spoke of positivity: The Apollo 11 moon landing, that \u201cgiant leap for mankind.\u201d We\u2019ve been watching the characters let TV into their lives, as screens appear tangentially in more and more scenes (and as Harry Crane has headed up the agency\u2019s TV department). Suddenly, everyone was gathered together around their TV sets looking at the universe, with Don reaching out to his daughter in one of his most genuinely paternal gestures. The moon landing scenes on \u201cMad Men\u201d were a kind of Kodak carousel ride, a paean to America\u2019s lost innocence.But is it possible, really, that \u201cMad Men\u201d has gone into hope mode? Will Peggy\u2019s professional triumph spread into her personal life when the show returns? Will Joan, who made her claim for love when she rejected Bob Benson, find a romantic partner who can deal with her newly owned power? Was this last half-season a final U-turn in the show, an ending that will be followed by a seven-episode epilogue \u2014 a novel-like winding down rather than a TV-like climax? Will we move forward with the characters into the future, with the flow of history, beyond the 1960s, as the office computer shrinks and multiplies?Or was this half-season only a feint toward well-being, before Weiner leads his characters back into restlessness, the two steps backward to this one step forward? Either way, elevator or carousel, I\u2019m betting it will be well worth waiting for.",

        "text": "ONLY IN NEW YORK: Some of today's most provocative and authentic Latin Caribbean literature is being created by Dominican, Cuban and Puerto Rican women writers in Flushing, 1,500 miles from the sun of their native islands. They have been doing it for three years in the living room of Prof. Daisy De Filippis' unpretentious home, where the group comes together one Sunday per month. She and Nunzio, her husband, cook for the group. On a recent day, the smell of spaghetti and shrimp was mouth-watering. De Filippis, a highly regarded authority on Dominican literature, teaches at CUNY's York College and is the author of several books. She holds a Ph.D. from City University and is one of the founders and the driving force of these meetings, or tertulias (the word means literary circle but also social gathering). \"We are not a workshop but a mutual audience,\" explains De Filippis. \"We read to each other our works in progress and can count on honest feedback.\" The feedback, encouraging or critical, is invariably well received because the women trust one another personally and artistically. The tertuliantes break all stereotypes. Mostly working women of color and of different ages, they do not fit pre-conceived notions about who writers are or how they look. More important, their works hardly fit their societies' definition of feminine literature. \"The images we present in our writings are often not comfortable,\" De Filippis says. Actually, they are staking out new ground for female writers. Their works defy traditional feminine qualities such as virginity, docility, domesticity, fragile beauty. They deal with realities largely ignored in men's books: domestic violence, child abuse, the plight of working-class mothers. They unabashedly celebrate love, sexuality and desire the younger ones and the grandmothers in the group alike. \"We are writing an honest diary of women's lives,\" says poet Annecy Baez Hernandez. \"Women writers are marginalized in our societies, so we support each other,\" says Sonia Rivera-Valdes, also a professor at York College with a Ph.D. from CUNY. \"We trust each other because we have no extra-literary agendas.\" If De Filippis is the clear-headed leader, the freshness and authenticity of group founder Rivera-Valdes have made her its artistic inspiration. Her collection of stories, \"Las Historias Prohibidas de Marta Veneranda\" (The Forbidden Stories of Marta Veneranda), recently won Cuba's Casa de las Americas Literary Award, one of the most important in Latin America. One of the youngest women in the group is Nelly Rosario, an environmental engineer from MIT. She is currently enrolled in a master of fine arts program at Columbia University. Yet, she says, \"I learn more here than in any of the courses I have ever taken.\" Rosario writes in English a minority in the group, although others, like novelist Ynoemia Villar, write in English and Spanish. Rosario has not been published, but, she says, a chapter of \"what could be a novel\" won first prize in a prestigious literary contest at the University of Virginia. Her colleagues are beaming with pride. \"The success of one is the success of all,\" says Marianela Medrano, a poet who lives in Connecticut. At the beginning of 1994, she approached De Filippis, worried about the loneliness of Dominican women writing in the U.S. In July of that year, the first tertulia took place at De Filippis' home. The rest, as they say, is history. ANOTHER TERTULIANTE, Yrene Santos, is a well-known poet in the Dominican Republic. Inadvertently, perhaps, she wrote what could very well be the tertulia's anthem: I want to be a woman not fragmented/ to shout fearless the answers I've known for years/ and have silenced . . . And she is doing it; they are all doing it. They are also bringing a little Caribbean sun to the streets of Flushing. Only in New York.",

        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif., March 7 (UPI) \u2014 Dr. Samuel Jackson Holmes, zoologist and eugenics pioneer, died at Kaiser Hospi\u00adtal here on Thursday, two days before his 96th birthday.Back in 1924, Dr. Holmes called attention to the preva\u00adlence of small families among the \u201chighly intelligent,\u201d which, he said, tended toward the ex\u00adtinction of the better endowed stock. In those days intelligence tests, developed during World War I, were accepted as an infallible means of identifying the \u201chighly intelligent.\u201dHe called attention to the problem by denouncing higher education as more devastating to the human race than war.In 1929 he said that the fu\u00adture would see a larger pro\u00adportion of Negroes in the North than in the South, a forecast that anticipated the movement of the Negro north but exag\u00adgerated its scope. He advanced evidence that Southern Negroes were able to adapt to the more rigorous climate of the north.Most of Dr. Holmes's chal\u00adlenging statements reflected the position of some of the pioneers of eugenics, who were unaware that large gaps existed in their knowledge.In 1939, as president of the Western division of the Ameri\u00adcan Association for the Ad\u00advancement of Science, he urged the substitution of a Darwinian code of morals for the ancient Hebraic and Christian codes.The Darwinian code, present\u00aded as an outgrowth of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, accepts cruelty, lust, deceit, cowardice and selfishness as in\u00adtrinsic \u201cvirtues\u201d but disapproves their abuse, he said.This idea, not original withDr. Holmes, was developed into a social philosophy called \u201cso\u00adcial Darwinism,\u201d which had a certain vogue in Nazi Germany and other countries but which later fell into disrepute.This public image tended to obscure the fact that he was one of the world's foremost au\u00adthorities on zoology and genetics, internationally known for his studies of animal hered\u00adity and behavior. He was one of the first scientists to recognize that radiation could create monsters.Dr. Holmes was born in Henry, Ill. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in science at the University of California and his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Chicago in 1897. After a year of teaching in the public schools of California, Dr. Holmes was an instructor in zoology for six years at the University of Mich\u00adigan.He then transferred to the University of Wisconsin, where he remained until 1912, when he went to California as an asso\u00adciate professor. He became pro\u00adfessor in 1917. Dr. Holmes taught at California, and also at the Marine Biological Labor\u00adatory at Wood's Hole, until his retirement in 1939.He married Cecelia WarfieldSkinner in 1909. They had five children, Samuel J., Marion V., Avis C., John W. and Joseph E. Holmes.This article can be viewed in its original form.

Commissioned by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority, the glowing swing set contains LED lights that activate based on the swings\u2019 movement. An internal accelerometer measures speeds, which signal the color changes.The swing set is part of the MCCA\u2019s initiative to create the first interactive public space in Boston. \u201cWe wanted to have a piece that would entice anyone to use it, not just stop and stare,\u201d said Jim Rooney, executive director of the MCCA.Part playground implement, part art installation, \u201cSwing Time\u201d was designed by Eric Howeler and Meejin Yoon of the Boston firm Howeler and Yoon Architecture. The husband-and-wife team has designed several art pieces meant to activate public spaces, including the award-winning \u201cWhite Noise/White Light\u201d field at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.Howeler, also an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said he wanted to blend the ideas of a responsive environment and a play space to \u201cSwing Time,\u201d in order to entice park goers to physically interact with it.\u201cThe stuff between buildings is often left to happenstance, and one of the best ways to bring life to the public realm is through art pieces like this one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stop playing at a certain age. And we were tasked with figuring out how to get everyone, including adults, to play.\u201dThe swing set joins several activities already dispersed across the 2.7-acre green space. The WiFi-equipped park offers bocce ball, corn hole, and other yard games, as well as an open-air bar Thursday through Sunday. The space hosts music events, and serves as a reception area for events at the BCEC.Rooney hopes that the many organizations and visitors who make their way to the waterfront for conventions, family outings, and the like will take advantage of the Lawn, designated as an experimental event space. \u201cWe want the space to be reflective of the innovative people who live and visit Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd especially this new community that the park resides in\u201d \u2014 Boston\u2019s new innovation district.Justin Saglio for The Boston GlobeAnna Kaertner at \u201cSwing Time.\u201dHoweler said he is happy that the MCCA sought to unite Boston\u2019s creative and technology cultures. \u201cBoston has the (Institute of Contemporary Art) and MIT and so many other institutions that are really shaping the world and the space within it in creative new ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such a historic city, but it also has this techy-geeky side that could visually shine through.\u201dBlending the Lawn\u2019s landscape and atmosphere into \u201cSwing Time\u201d was a pivotal design component, Howeler said. Planning and constructing the piece was a robust process, requiring input from structural engineers, electrical engineers, and computer programmers to prepare it for installation.\u201cWe bring the whimsical aspect with the technological components of the piece, but that was also the work that was truly meticulous and important to get right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to help create a community here, so those details are the ones that need to shine through.\u201d And in the case of \u201cSwing Time,\u201d those details emit a purple glow.",

        "text": "You\u2019re one of the last charter Team Obama guys still on the job. What\u2019s keeping you around?I never set out to work in the White House. What drew me to the campaign was really the opportunity to work for Barack Obama. I don\u2019t necessarily see this as a situation where I\u2019m going to be going through the revolving door, in and out of administrations. I happen to have found somebody who I really love to work for, who I have a really good relationship with, and it\u2019s hard to walk away from that.Do you ever feel envious of friends you started with, who\u2019re out now and setting their hours?Anybody who leaves here, you see them a couple months later and they look a lot better. They look 20 pounds lighter and five years younger. So it does give you some envy, because you see the physical toll the job takes on you. You see everybody moving, some in Washington, some out to California, and you realize there are many green pastures out there. I still come to work in a windowless office in the basement of the White House. But the other side of the coin is that there\u2019s no other job like this. When you walk out that door for the last time here, you realize your ability to be at the center of events and decision-making on momentous things that are changing the course of history, that goes away. It cuts both ways.You had a choice when you entered public life between this and pursuing a career as an author. Is that still the plan when you leave?I had originally been looking at writing, including fiction. When I leave here, I would certainly want to do my own writing, but more in the non-fiction realm \u2014 books, long-form journalism, and related opportunities. So I haven\u2019t given it much thought beyond that. But after writing for somebody else for so many years, it will be interesting to pivot back to doing things in my own voice.What advice would you give to somebody who wants to follow your path, about the most relevant experience you had to land you this job?People make a mistake when they think that if you just accumulate a set number of things on your resume, it\u2019s going to lead you to a particular place \u2014 the pattern of essentially compiling credentials to climb your way up a ladder. That may work, but that\u2019s not at all what happened to me. I found people I really wanted to work for; I made myself available to do whatever I could with the skills I had; I took some risk, packing up and moving to Chicago; and I looked for the opportunities that fit for me. So I think the biggest advice is to find people you love to work for who you\u2019re going to learn from.You and the President obviously spend a lot of time together. Do you have any travel rituals? What do you do on the plane?He\u2019s a card player, I\u2019m not. But I\u2019ve gone on all of his foreign trips. We\u2019ll have very intense schedules. One ritual is he likes to find little pockets of down time in the day to just unwind, talk about other things, to be relaxed. But the one ritual that\u2019s always the case is that on speeches, he works very late, so he\u2019ll constantly be making line edits and fiddling with text up until the last minute. So you get a lot of late nights, especially on the big speeches. So you have to kind of pace yourself with the expectation you\u2019re not going to get a lot of sleep, that you\u2019ve got to find ways to relax over the course of the day and that you need to have a reserve of mental energy that you can draw from. That\u2019s the rhythm that you get into on these foreign trips that can be quite a grind.When you\u2019re actually in the White House, how long is your typical day? Can you characterize it?I\u2019ll get in around 8 and get an intelligence briefing at the beginning of the day, and then go into a series of morning meetings that are about figuring out what we need in place for that day. The afternoons tend to be meetings or work on what policies are running through a process, what are the next big things we\u2019re getting ready for, the next big trip, the next big speech, the next big rollout of a policy. And I\u2019ll tend to be at work from 8 to 8. But the thing about this job, it\u2019s not so much the hours in the office\u2014it\u2019s that you\u2019re always on call. So you\u2019ll end up having to answer email and do things up until you go to bed at 12 or 1 in the morning. So even when you\u2019re home, you\u2019re still working. That\u2019s particularly true in foreign policy. The other day, when we launched airstrikes in Syria, we obviously knew that was going to happen, but that happens overnight, so you basically end up being up all night. You don\u2019t get to control the timing of when things happen in foreign policy like you do in other areas. If something happens in North Korea, or the Middle East or Ukraine, you have to respond to it no matter what time of day it is. So it ends up making you essentially on call 24 hours a day.What\u2019s the most important speech you\u2019ve worked on so far? I\u2019m wondering where the UN speech ranks.The UN speech is definitely one of the most important, because it\u2019s intended to set the tone for the next year or so going forward, here in the United States but also globally. It\u2019s the roadmap for we\u2019re doing, where we\u2019re trying to go, what we expect of others. There have been a handful of speeches like that. The Cairo speech in 2009, in some ways the Nobel speech he gave, which in some ways was a window into his view of the world that endures well. They break through in a way because they\u2019re bigger than the precise moment we\u2019re in. They\u2019re about laying down markers for what\u2019s going to define the U.S. role in the world for a period of time to come.Ben Rhodes, left with President Obama and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough on Air Force OnePhoto: Pete Souza\u2014The White House/Getty ImagesDid you revisit the Cairo and Nobel speeches in writing this one? How\u2019d they inform it?I actually find the two things I always try to do before working on a big speech are to go back and read relevant speeches by President Obama and by other presidents. It\u2019s interesting to see how other presidents deal with similar moments in time. How did other Presidents speak at the UN at times of significant international turmoil or the beginning of a military action? For President Obama, I often try to go back and look at the foundational speeches. So, what did we say at the UN in previous years? What\u2019s in Cairo speech, what\u2019s in the Nobel speech, even going back to the campaign. And you try to find a thread you can pull forward and update. Even sometimes there\u2019s specific language that you seek to use again to make sure there\u2019s a thread of consistency to the message.Are there speeches by other presidents you referenced specifically for his latest UN address?I looked at the 1961 speech to the General Assembly by John F. Kennedy, and I actually ended up putting a quote from that speech in this one. There, too, the theme was essentially a world at a crossroads and having to make a choice between different paths. And so that ended up impacting how we framed this speech. We looked at others, too, and it\u2019s interesting to see how different presidents make use of that particular world stage.Looking past the current military campaign, how hopeful are you about a lasting peace, in whatever way you want to define that, presiding in the Middle East in the mid- to long-term? Some people are seeing nothing less than a civilizational collapse that\u2019s not fixable in our lifetimes.The reason I have to optimistic is that it\u2019s the one thing everybody in the region seems to agree on\u2013that this is such a shocking organization that it\u2019s stirred people out of complacency and opened the doors to alliances that weren\u2019t previously possible. We had the Iraqi prime minister in a meeting with the five Arab nations in our coalition, who have Sunni-led governments. That would not have been thinkable even six months ago. If everybody maintains the current sense of urgency, you can see a pathway for this group to be steadily eroded, but also something better taking its place in terms of a new approach to regional stability. And the other thing I\u2019d say is we can fall into a trap of making these groups and threats out to be more resilient than they really are. With Al Qaeda, we\u2019ve shown that if we just keep the pressure on and have a consensus against an organization, the organization in Afghanistan and Pakistan for intents and purposes is at best a shadow of its former self. The challenge is now doing that in the heart of the Middle East with this group and other extremist satellite. But part of the reason the President gave the speech that he gave is to make clear this can\u2019t just be us launching a bunch of airstrikes. This has to be a much broader effort.Most of our readers would agree with the assessment behind the rebalance to Asia, that economically the center of gravity in the world is shifting there. It also seems unavoidable with ISIS, and Israel, and Ukraine, and Ebola, that your focus is directed elsewhere right now. How do you deal with that?You have to be very disciplined to make sure that even as you\u2019re working the urgent issues, you\u2019re not neglecting what I\u2019d say are the opportunity pieces of your agenda. And the rebalance to Asia is certainly part of that. So for instance, when I went up to the UN with the President, even as we had to work on the speech and all the elements of the coalition building, I carved out two hours for a meeting with the presidential advisor from Burma to talk about the President\u2019s upcoming trip there. It would have been easier to just scrap something like that and focus on ISIL. But you have to be disciplined and remember that you have to focus on the opportunities in the world and not just the threats. The fact is in the long run those may end up making a bigger difference, because there you can make progress and you can build new ways of doing things. The key to it is looking at your schedule at the beginning of the week, and saying to yourself, As easy as it would be to only do the Middle East this week, I have to set aside some time for Africa, for Asia, for Latin America\u2014which we generally define as the opportunity regions\u2014and be sure we\u2019re hitting our marks on them.You\u2019re part of the first brother team to make this list. What was your dynamic with [older brother David, president of CBS News] growing up? Did you argue politics over the dinner table?We always got along very well. We definitely had different political perspectives. But in my family we were encouraged to argue about everything over the dinner table. And I think since then, we\u2019ve never been competitive, in part because we\u2019re in different fields. He\u2019s in media, I\u2019m in politics and foreign policy and that makes it easier for us to root for each other without competing in the same territory.Does knowing him make you more or less cynical about media?Seeing his perspective about what people are interested in over the years definitely helped me understand that the media is in a high pressure business of their own and they have to find ways in a crowded information environment to report the news in a way that gets peoples attention. It gives me an understanding of the dynamic on the other end of the phone when I\u2019m talking to a reporter, which I have to do a fair amount of.This story is from the October 27, 2014 issue of Fortune.",

        "text": "FORTUNE \u2014 In August 2013, transgender television personality B. Scott filed a suit against Black Entertainment Television and its parent company Viacom Inc., claiming that the network had discriminated against him based on his gender identity and sexual orientation.The lawsuit stemmed from Scott\u2019s appearance as a style correspondent at the 2013 BET awards preshow. After his first segment of the night, in which he appeared with heavy makeup and heels, the network told him to tone down his look and change into masculine clothing that was \u201cdifferent from the androgynous style he\u2019s used to \u2026 and comfortable with,\u201d according to the complaint.A Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided the case Wednesday, and it came down to the First Amendment; not Scott\u2019s freedom to speech and expression, but Viacom\u2019s VIA . The court found that BET\u2019s decision as to how Scott would appear on camera was part of the network\u2019s creative process of developing and broadcasting the show, which is protected by the First Amendment.MORE: Americans have fallen in love with real estate once againThe case is by no means the first in which a media company has used the First Amendment as a defense against lawsuits alleging discrimination. The order on Thursday cites several other instances.There was the racial discrimination case against ABC for its failure to feature non-white contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. A federal district court in Tennessee dismissed the matter after finding that \u201ccasting decisions are a necessary component of any entertainment show\u2019s creative content.\u201d The court said that \u201cthe plaintiffs seek to drive an artificial wedge between casting decisions and the end product, which itself is indisputably protected as speech by the First Amendment.\u201dAnd there was the lawsuit filed against Warner Bros. by a former writers\u2019 assistant for the television show Friends who asserted that the use of sexually coarse and vulgar language and conduct by the show\u2019s writers constituted sexual harassment. The Supreme Court of California in that case held that \u201cthe First Amendment protects creativity.\u201dThe case that held greatest precedent is a matter in which a group of gay, lesbian, and bisexual Irish Americans sought to participate in Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. The U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately heard the case, ruled that it would be a violation of the First Amendment for Massachusetts to require private citizens \u201cwho organize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey.\u201dThe defendants in these cases argued that they didn\u2019t care what their employees or participants are in reality \u2014 gay, straight, male, female \u2014 but rather how they appear. \u201cThey say, \u2018We are entitled to create a program that looks the way we want it to look,\u2019\u201d says Eugene Volokh, a professor at UCLA School of Law. And the courts have agreed with them.MORE: The market for marketing software is accelerating rapidlyReporting the news and creating a television show both qualify as exercises of free speech, according to Thursday\u2019s ruling in the Scott case. Outside those realms, however, the First Amendment defense against discrimination claims doesn\u2019t work as well. Abercrombie & Fitch anf , for instance, lost a bias suit filed by a Muslim employee that it fired because she refused to remove her head scarf. Abercrombie had argued that any deviation from its dress code threatened the company\u2019s success and that the lawsuit violated its First Amendment right to commercial free speech. A federal judge in California disagreed.\u201cThe First Amendment line is really drawn at news and entertainment,\u201d Volokh says. The Supreme Court has found that \u201cpeople who make visual imagery are allowed to control what\u2019s in it.\u201d",

        "text": "Six Egyptians \u2013 possibly attendants of the Victorian photographer Francis Bedford and his companions \u2013 are arranged in a receding zigzag across the rough, uneven floor, dwarfed by walls, pillars and doorjambs in an austere, finely detailed 1862 image of the Ptolemaic Temple of Horus. Bedford must have insisted on between 10 and 12 seconds of complete stillness from the human figures in this majestic work, fully consonant with the 19th-century vogue for the timeless, immovable east \u2013 except for one deliberate anachronism. Between two of the pillars stands a white canvas hut. Here is Bedford\u2019s portable darkroom, scene of minute struggles with the collodion process for making glass negatives. Thus an art form barely 20 years old breaks the repose of Ozymandias.The photograph is one of around 190 that Bedford took when he accompanied the 20-year-old Prince of Wales, Albert Edward (\u201cBertie\u201d), on a four-month tour of the Middle East in 1862, and which entered the Royal Collection after his return. They are currently on display at the Queen\u2019s Gallery in London, in a handsome exhibition that does not, however, fully explore all the possibilities of its subject.The Prince of Wales, as we are not told in the Queen\u2019s Gallery, was under a cloud. The previous summer he had been initiated into the pleasures of the flesh by an Irish girl named Nellie, and it was from such beginnings that his scandalised father, Prince Albert, hit on the idea of an improving tour of the Ottoman dominions, focusing on the Holy Lands. But Albert had since died, his decline accelerated by his son\u2019s \u201cfall\u201d, and this made Bertie doubly odious to the grief-stricken Queen, who insisted that the trip go ahead while she plotted to marry him off. The prince, enjoying a gentle degree at Cambridge, and evincing no wanderlust, was powerless to resist.Setting off from Venice in February 1862, the smallish royal party (the principals consisted of Bertie, his governor, General Robert Bruce, and a handful of other, carefully selected, male companions) steamed down the Dalmatian coast and crossed the Mediterranean to Alexandria. From Egypt they went on to explore Palestine and Syria, living in tents and escorted by Ottoman cavalrymen, before sailing back to Europe via Constantinople. The trip took four and a half months, with Bedford as official photographer. His task was to immortalise scenes that were, as the Photographic News put it, \u201cfraught with historic and sacred associations\u201d.Bedford was an experienced architectural and topographical photographer, with royal commissions already behind him, and he fulfilled his brief brilliantly. His harmonious, granular studies of the Egyptian temples and the Roman ruins at Baalbek, in Lebanon, accentuate the neglected, yet romantic, character of these places, with locals used for scale or foreground interest but offering no serious counterweight to the ruins among which they graze their goats or (in the case of Coptic Christians, appropriating part of a Pharoanic complex) come to pray.The biblical sites as depicted by Bedford seem virtually unchanged since the Saviour\u2019s time. His Sea of Galilee, for instance, shimmers softly in a landscape that is empty but for the ruins of Tiberias \u2013 where the royal party took Easter communion. And there is little in his image of Jerusalem from Mount of Olives to suggest that these are not the very trees among which Jesus wept the night before his crucifixion.It would have been helpful, in the sumptuously illustrated catalogue by Sophie Gordon, to have learned more about the religious importance of these places, which is so vividly evoked in contemporary pilgrims\u2019 accounts. Among these accounts are the entertaining letters of the liberal churchman Arthur Stanley, who was on the tour as Bertie\u2019s spiritual chaperone.Artists and even photographers had trodden the same paths before (the Englishman Francis Frith as recently as 1860), but each year, as the photo-historian Badr El Hage notes in his useful catalogue essay, brought more pilgrims, scholars and diplomats to a region that had seen few westerners since the Crusades. Passenger steamships (P&O began plying the eastern Mediterranean in 1835), guidebooks and the first Thomas Cook package tour gave notice of a harder, more permanent intrusion, with western museums filling up with Mediterranean fragments, the great powers using their concern for the Holy Places and religious minorities as a pretext for elbowing into Ottoman affairs, and, already, those mellow voids inspiring thoughts of a Jewish state.The Tsar\u2019s brother had made his tearful pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre three years before, the Russian foreign ministry minuting that \u201cJerusalem is the centre of the world and our mission must be there\u201d. The British and French felt the same.Of the historical aspects of the itinerary, the Prince of Wales was indefatigably ignorant \u2013 as we know from Arthur Stanley, who felt affection for his boyish, good-humoured charge, but there was no denying that the young man was less moved by the scene of Elijah\u2019s sacrifice on Mount Carmel than the prospect of shooting quail on the same slopes, and if he wasn\u2019t complaining about all the \u201ctumbledown\u201d temples, he spent his time testing his travel companions on the plot of a recent potboiler.Bertie was a keen souvenir hunter, acquiring, among other things, a mummy whose excavation he had witnessed, a papyrus funerary text and a beautiful scarab made of glazed, blue-green soapstone, which he had mounted on tiny gold python heads, as a brooch. (Except for the mummy, which has disappeared, these objects have been included in the exhibition.)For the more thoughtful members of the party, there were considerable advantages to be gained from travelling with the heir to a quarter of the globe, not least permissions to visit the sepulchre of the Patriarchs at Hebron, hitherto inaccessible to Christians, and Jerusalem\u2019s Dome of the Rock, whose dilapidated dignity (it has since been lavishly restored) Bedford was one of the earliest photographers to record. \u201cThe prince entered the mosque,\u201d crowed the Illustrated London News, \u201cstanding where no infidel has stood since the Crusades.\u201d In Jerusalem, Bertie was tattooed with the Crusaders\u2019 Jerusalem Cross on his forearm.Along with the great Umayyad Mosque at Damascus, also somewhat shabby through Bedford\u2019s lens, the Dome of the Rock is one of the few subjects that look better now than a century and a half ago. The pyramids have been all but consumed by Cairo\u2019s sprawl, and the then-sleepy Lebanese port of Tripoli, also photographed by Bedford, by Sunni-Shia conflict.Religious bloodshed was indeed a theme of the later stages of the tour, from visits to Crusader castles to the aftermath of a rankling three-way enmity between Christians, Sunnis and Druze. In 1860, Druze bands had laid waste to hundreds of Christian settlements in Lebanon \u2013 including the village of Hasbiya, which Bedford photographed. Most affecting, however, are his images of Christian Damascus, annihilated in the same year, with the buildings reduced to carcasses and not a soul in sight. Also in Damascus, Bedford made a rare portrait of an exiled Algerian nationalist leader who had given Christians sanctuary in his home.Nowadays it is tempting to see communal conflict as endemic in the Levant and Mesopotamia, but the pogroms, whose effects the royal party witnessed had been notably rare until the 1840s. Bertie waxed indignant at Ottoman misrule, but Europe\u2019s sponsorship of local clients (for years Britain had supported the Druze, while the French backed the Maronites) had helped upset the old religious balances in the first place, foreshowing the cataclysmic communal violence of the final decades of the Ottoman empire.Even the cheapness of English cloth had sharpened resentments between the various groups, enriching the Christian agents of the Manchester houses and impoverishing Muslim weavers \u2013 unintended consequences of the Industrial Revolution and globalisation.In June 1862, the tourists went their separate ways \u2013 Stanley nursing a mix of pilgrim\u2019s joy and filial sadness, for his mother had died in his absence, and Bruce a violent fever that would quickly kill him. Bedford got to work printing and exhibiting; his technique was commended by the cognoscenti and his images snapped up by the pious. As Gordon\u2019s biographical essay tells us, he went on to become a much-respected (and wealthy) photographer, and left \u201can extraordinary photographic legacy, much of which remains to be discovered\u201d.Queen Victoria found Bertie \u201cmuch improved\u201d by his travels, and \u201cready to do everything as I wish\u201d. Stanley was less sanguine, writing of \u201cthe difficulty of producing any impression on a mind with no previous knowledge or interest to be awakened\u201d. For all that, seven years later the prince would be drawn back to the Holy Land, this time in the company of his wife, the former Princess Alexandra of Denmark \u2013 and the recipient, as it turned out, of that beautiful, blue-green, python-mounted scarab.\u2022 Cairo to Constantinople: Early Photographs of the Middle East is at the Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London SW1A, until 22 February",

        "text": "Discussions about startups often focus on founders or investors, but most people in the startup game are regular employees. So how do you find a startup job?\u201cI want to work for a startup.\u201d It\u2019s a common statement, but a \u201cstartup\u201d can be very different things. The primary dimension on which startups differ is stage: Two guys in a garage is definitely a startup. So is a 30-person company growing with a second round of financing, and so is a 250-person company preparing for an IPO.The first decision, and the most critical decision, of what type of startup to join is based on the current stage of the company. This selection is the most personal and subjective one, as it\u2019s based on a person\u2019s motivations for why they want to be a part of a startup in the first place (as opposed to just getting a job at xyz company) \u2014 desire to make an impact, better working in smaller teams, excitement to be involved with cutting-edge technology, aspirations of becoming a founder and/or a startup CEO, working with other motivated people, long-term financial upside, etc. But this juncture is also where I see people make a critical mistake.The biggest mistake I see is people going to Series A or B funded startups because they perceive it as \u201csafe\u201d with VC backing, but the only thing *temporarily* derisked is financing. And that derisking is only for 12+/-6 months. Yet the company hasn\u2019t figured out its product-market fit, hasn\u2019t figured out its customer proposition, doesn\u2019t have revenue\u2026 it doesn\u2019t have traction.As an employee joining, you bear (nearly) all the risk as the founders but an order of magnitude less in compensation, recognition, and influence.I believe that there are three opportune times to join a startup:As early as you can stomach. For some, the proverbial two-guys-in-a-garage-stage is the ultimate allure\u2026 but they\u2019re not ready just yet to be one of those couple founders. Push yourself hard to ask why am I not a founder now? If the reason is the need for an initial idea, a specific skillset, time to develop a potential customer network, etc., then the right answer is to find a role and company which fits that description so that after a few short years you\u2019re ready\u2026 usually that\u2019s not a seed-stage startup. If the reason is that you haven\u2019t done it before but just want to learn the playbook, then by all means joining an extremely embryonic team is the right next step. Of course many people have current income requirements that the earliest-stage team can\u2019t satisfy; hence, reality does dictate that this rule is amended from \u201cas early as possible\u201d to as \u201cearly as you can stomach.\u201dBut if you\u2019re stomach feels queasy reading any of the above, it really makes sense to jump ahead to a much later stage startup where the\u2026Train has left the station. What I mean is that the startup is already on track, generating real revenue, rapidly growing (and hiring), and is clearly destined to be some type of success. It\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s going to be either a \u201cwin\u201d or a \u201cmonster win,\u201d but a reasonable outcome is reasonably assured. In other words, the train has left the station heading towards a destination and will get there if you\u2019re on board or not. Of course you\u2019re going to make an impact (that\u2019s one reason why you\u2019re joining a startup after all), but the company is already moving forward with its own inertia.If you aren\u2019t ready to be a founder soon, this point is the best place to join a startup. Yes, it\u2019s larger and doesn\u2019t have the same feel as \u201cthose early days,\u201d but the benefits of joining this profile company are numerous:Even though it is a smart strategy to join later in the game, realize that you miss out on acquiring some startup founder skills (searching for a repeatable model, the emotional roller coaster, etc.). But if a founding role isn\u2019t your plan, there are some people who are just better suited to the scaling-stage of a startup \u2014 and that\u2019s a great thing. These are people who are probably never going to be founders, but make great VPs of engineering and marketing, etc for late-stage companies\u2026 and they do it successfully again and again.Learn and work with people or in a special situation. Going extremely early or very late is the right approach 90% of the time. The exception to the rule is just that \u2014 when there is an exceptional opportunity at the in-between. There are situations where you have opportunity to work with someone renowned in industry. Or you have a special skillset that would apply to your role.The last reason to join a mid-stage startup, and the most compelling one, is that given your prior experience you have a unique perspective to recognize that the company has been or will be de-risked in some way that hasn\u2019t fully been realized yet. It\u2019s easy to craft a story to cite one of the above cases is present, but the true test is convincing yourself that it\u2019s true.Regardless of what stage startup you join, the choice should be just that \u2013something which you chose, a deliberate selection based on criteria that you\u2019re optimizing around and the potential of upside, not a perception about safety. You should be joining a startup because of your excitement about the role or situation, the company itself and the opportunities ahead with the chance to change the world, not as a hedging strategy.David Beisel is a venture capitalist focused on the digital media space.

And they may frame the conversation around her longer-term goals or the important people in her life \u2014 perhaps a child with a college savings account, or an elderly parent. The representative may ask more open-ended questions.Women will ultimately receive the same guidance that would be offered to similarly situated men \u2014 but when appropriate, the representative\u2019s conversational style may differ. Fidelity said its goal was not to patronize women or to wrap its mutual funds and services in frilly pink bows. Instead, it says it wants to connect with different people \u2014 including women \u2014 about savings and investing in a way that will resonate, based on findings from its internal research and analysis.\u201cWith men, many want a Reader\u2019s Digest conversation \u2014 they want what they came for,\u201d said Jeanne Thompson, a vice president at Fidelity who was involved in the research. \u201cHowever, reps realize that women appreciate hearing what it means for them and want a deeper explanation.\u201dFidelity, which provides employer-based retirement accounts for more than 13 million workers, and other retirement plan providers have begun tailoring their messages for specific employees \u2014 including women, but also Hispanics, members of specific generations or income groups, or those, say, who may be borrowing significant sums from their 401(k) plans. Other providers are testing ways to nudge workers to save more with just one click.\u201cWhat we are seeing is a big uptick in the number of organizations that are thinking more broadly about financial wellness and understanding it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all plan that will get results,\u201d said Betsy Dill, a partner at Mercer, a consulting firm. \u201cThey have to think about how to segment and micro-target their work force at different points along the way.\u201dThere are a lot of headlines about how women aren\u2019t as comfortable with money as their male counterparts, but the research is mixed. The financial services industry conducts plenty of self-serving surveys reinforcing stereotypes, but they\u2019re trying to capture women\u2019s business: More women are their household\u2019s primary breadwinner, and they control trillions of dollars.And among women with access to retirement plans? They are doing just fine when compared with their male counterparts, raising questions about whether any special handling is warranted. In fact, some research has found that certain differences in behavior are hinged less to gender and more to socioeconomic status.So why the special treatment at Fidelity?\u201cA lot of this is in reaction to research around the sentiment and confidence of women,\u201d Thompson of Fidelity added. \u201cBut a lot of this is because many women are the heads of households and they are the breadwinners.\u201d",

        "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan. 26\u2014 A large national gathering of Christian evangelicals, including hundreds of television and radio broadcasters, was urged today to bolster the campaign by evangelical political activists to combat secular humanism, which was described as ''the established religion of America.''The challenge was delivered by the Rev. D. James Kennedy, the pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a leading figure in the recent drive by conservative church groups to help elect candidates who espoused views that agreed with fundamentalist moral principles.Mr. Kennedy also serves on the board of the Round Table, an umbrella group for religiously conservative activists. He told 2,000 delegates at a joint meeting of National Religious Broadcasters and the National Association of Evangelicals that evangelicals should increase their level of political involvement because ''secular humanists have declared war on Christianity in this country and they are progressing very rapidly.''Declaring that the public had been largely ''brainwashed'' into believing that the Constitution placed restrictions on churchconnected political activity, Mr. Kennedy asked: ''What does it really say about what the church can do and can't do? Absolutely nothing.''Turning to the subject of secular humanism, a term often used to define a viewpoint that disregards religion as a factor in solving human problems, Mr. Kennedy linked its alleged rise to growing atheism and moral laxity on issues such as abortion, homosexuality and pornography.As the political wave among conservative Christians has grown, secular humanism has been blamed for a variety of social and moral ills and represents the main focus of the conservative attack.The activism by Christian political groups was considered a significant factor in the election of many conservative candidates, including President Reagan, who seemed to reflect fundamentalist opposition to abortion, civil rights for homosexuals and the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as their backing of prayer in the public schools.But appeals for evangelical support for this activist movement have met mixed reactions among conservative church people. The tensions among the various segments of conservative Christianity have been apparent in the early stages of the joint four-day meeting at the Sheraton Washington Hotel. Divergence Among EvangelicalsThe frictions are mirrored in the two organizations, which represent different constituencies and, to a large degree, distinct points of view on the question.The National Association of Evangelicals, the older group, founded in 1941, is composed of 36,000 member congregations from a wide variety of evangelical denominations.It reflects many of the moderate theological and moral views that tend to include distrust of single-issue politics, and it often criticizes the tendency of the new Christian right to identify certain political positions as being the only ones authenticated by the Bible. Many in this group also complain of the attempt to form what they see as a quasi political Christian party.Marlin Van Elderen, a leading evangelical, underscored this criticism in an article in United Evangelical Action, the official publication of the N.A.E.Among the dangers of the activism. Mr. Van Elderen said, is ''enshrining one's own particular political and ethical judgments as the biblical viewpoint.''No person or organization - not the World Council of Churches nor the National Association of Evangelicals, not Jerry Falwell nor Pope John Paul II -speaks on behalf of biblical Christianity in matters social and political,'' he wrote. Criticism of BraodcastersThe disagreements are accompanied by attacks on evangelical broadcasters. The National Religious Broadcasters, begun under the auspices of the N.A.E. in 1943 as a special interest group, has in many ways overshadowed its parent. This rivalry is intensified by the widespread suspicion that media evangelists are causing neglect of local churches by siphoning away members and money.Attacks on evangelical broadcasters came from two sources today. George Sweeting, president of the Moody Bible Institute, warned that the ''parachurch movement,'' which includes a broad scope of evangelical efforts beyond the local church, among them television and radio ministries, threatens to become the ''tail that wags the dog.'' He appealed for a ''recovery of the centrality of the local church.''Mr. Sweeting also criticized television evangelism for running the risks of ''extravagant spending and an elegant lifestyle,'' resorting to ''unwise methods of fund-raising ... substituting entertainment for the word of God'' and ''adding our own culture to the Gospel.''",

        "text": "If you consider flying one of life\u2019s miseries, you might be flying the wrong airline.A new survey suggests that air travel is slowly improving, led by a small group of airlines.Passengers who fly JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines had the highest satisfaction rating \u2014 800 and 781, respectively, out of a possible score of 1000, according to J.D. Power\u2019s latest North America Airline Satisfaction study.Overall passenger satisfaction with major airlines increased to 717 out of a possible score of 1000 in 2015, up from 712 a year ago, according to J.D. Power\u2019s study.Here are some of the major findings:The study gauged passenger satisfaction among both business and leisure passengers in several key areas, including costs, fees, in-flight services, onboard experience and reservations. It was conducted between April 2014 and March 2015. J.D. Power distinguishes between \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201clow-cost\u201d carriers in its ranking, but Fortune combined them for this report.The findings reflect another recent study on airline service, which also suggested airline service was trending higher.To put these scores into a little perspective, the top-ranked airline would receive an equivalent letter grade of \u201cB-.\u201d The highest-scoring legacy carrier, Delta Air Lines, would get a \u201cC-.\u201d The lowest-ranked carriers receive a grade of \u201cD,\u201d according to its customers.Airlines still rank below banks and mortgage lenders, two other industries covered by J.D. Power. \u201cAirline customer service experience is low,\u201d says Rick Garlick, global travel and hospitality practice lead at J.D. Power. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting better.\u201dWhat the findings mean for customersJ.D. Power says the findings show that customer service matters, perhaps now more than ever. In its view, the airline industry is evolving from a commoditized transportation business into a business focused on hospitality and services.\u201cThe carriers most focused on providing a pleasant experience are being rewarded with higher customer satisfaction and loyalty,\u201d says Garlick.He says the study suggests that when passengers make the decision to fly an airline based on the services or experience the airline provides, rather than price, convenient routes and scheduling, satisfaction is higher and passengers are more likely to return to the airline brand and to recommend it to others.But there\u2019s another reason for the uptick in scores, and they have nothing to do with better service.\u201cPeople have adapted to the airline fees that use to upset them,\u201d adds Garlick. \u201cSo it might be more accurate to say people are less dissatisfied.\u201dA closer look at the J.D. Power numbers shows how various airlines succeeded \u2014 and failed.American and Delta surged ahead by investing in their customer service infrastructure and training, with an emphasis on high-revenue business travelers. Alaska\u2019s downward swing can be explained by some of its growing pains, as it expands to new cities where passengers are less familiar with the brand. And the failure of airlines such as United and Frontier? Garlick says those airlines have focused on low fares and high fees, to the detriment of customer service.\u201cEveryone wants low-cost travel,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut there\u2019s a price to be paid for it. The low-ranked carriers are running their companies so frugally that not even their core customers are satisfied. They\u2019re willing to pay for a better experience.\u201dA long way to goCritics agree that airline service still has a way to go before it can be considered good. \u201cAs the airlines have been complaining that customers are treating their seats like commodities, the airlines themselves are treating their passengers \u2014 except frequent flier elites and first class \u2014 like self-loading cargo,\u201d says Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy organization for air travelers. \u201cOnboard services have been ratcheted back, extra and exorbitant fees are being loaded on passengers, and legroom and seat sizes continue to shrink.\u201dLeocha says investing in customer service doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. A simple smile from flight attendants or gate agents, waiving a standby fee to get on an earlier flight with empty seats, allowing families to sit together without paying more, all make the travel experience far more pleasant.\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he adds, \u201cthese amenities still seem to be in short supply.\u201d",

There are Japanese lanterns, and, from the Italians, a re-creation of an entire range of the Alps, 15 feet high with ski trails down its slopes.The scene is the Alte Bahnhof, the old train station that has been divided into five sections and converted to an exhibition hall where cities from Canada, Italy, Sweden, Japan and South Korea are displaying the pleasures and advantages of holding a Winter or Summer Olympic Games in their locale.In another part of town, at Kurhaus, the main hall, the 11th Olympic Congress is convened. The International Olympic Committee is meeting along with representatives from the 147 nations that compete in the Games and delegates from 26 international sporting federations. Today, each of the five cities delivered its official presentation to the 84th session of the I.O.C., whose 81 members will vote tomorrow to determine the sites for the 1988 Games.The Summer Games candidates are Nagoya of Central Japan and Seoul of South Korea. The Winter Games candidates are Calgary of the Canadian province of Alberta; Cortina d'Ampezzo, a village in Northern Italy, and Falun, in Sweden.At times, Baden-Baden resembles the host city of an American political convention. There are campaign buttons, posters, free fountain pens on which slogans are written, caucuses and communication by walkie-talkie as the representatives of the aspiring five cities stalk and buttonhole anyone they believe might have the ear of an I.O.C. delegate.Some of the lobbyists for the candidate cities have been on the job for more than 20 years. They are well versed in the I.O.C. questionnaire that sets guidelines on such issues as airports, financial stability and technological capability for transmitting radio and television signals. Each city must also guarantee that there will be proper security to control political demonstrations at Olympic venues. To show good faith, a Summer Games candidate must post a bond of 500,000 Swiss francs, about $250,000; Winter Games candidates mu st post half that amount. Years of PreparationEach city answered the questionnaire and submitted it to the I.O.C. at least six months before the voting. But any city seriously considering a bid must start preparing for its formal presentation two to three years in advance, after first sounding out its population's desire to have the Games. This, too, is an I.O.C. requirement and is usually done by public poll, though Calgary's indication of such interest was the receiving of more than 80,000 donations at $5 apiece from a city population of 600,000.Representatives from the five cities talk constantly of their financial solvency, the excellence of facilities and the comforts that will be available for I.O.C. delegates and other officials. The five groups -Calgary has more than 40 people here - conduct strategy meetings that last past midnight. Protesters From JapanEach candidate city must also strive to diminish the apparent disadvantages of its site. Nagoya's bid has been countered somewhat by a handful of Japanese who traveled here to picket and display signs saying ''No Olympics for Nagoya.'' They are protesting possible environmental damage at Olympic venues and disturbances of local burial grounds.Seoul's chief concern is the possibility that the I.O.C. may face political problems in a city where 17 Communist nations boycotted the 1978 world shooting championships, and where in 1979 the Czechoslovak, Bulgarian and the world champion Soviet teams boycotted the women's championships in basketball.Calgary may have to overcome negative attitudes created in the I.O.C. when Canada joined the United States-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow. Cortina, which was host to the 1956 Winter Olympics, is a small town with limited access roads that might remind the committee of transportation problems in 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid, N.Y. And, although Falun has the most compact and efficient arrangement of competitive sites, the Swedish city has no mountain range suitable for Alpine skiing; the closest one is more than 200 miles away. Important 30 MinutesToday, the presentations were made in alphabetical order: Calgary, Cortina D'Ampezzo, Falun, Nagoya and Seoul. Each city had 30 minutes to present its case - generally done with brief film or slide showings and speeches - followed by unlimited questioning from the I.O.C. Yesterday, Jack Wilson, one of six delegate s representing Calgary at the presentation, said, ''Win or lose, we have no regrets - we've given it our best shot.'' This morning, after the presentation, he walked out of the hall looking both shaken an d satisfied. He looked back and, referring to the more than 1,000 co lor slides of Calgary that had been shown, he said, ''I can't ever watch that presentation without crying.''Sigge Bergman, a Swede preparing to speak in behalf of Falun, paced a corridor, telling reporters, ''I cannot talk to you now; I must save my voice for the presentation.'' When he emerged from the presentation, he said, ''I did my best; I can't do any more.''The Italians gathered in the foyer, lamenting how their short film had broke in the midst of their presentation. By day's end, the years of effort and campaigning had come to an end. By tomorrow afternoon, two delegations will be preparing for the 1988 Games, and the other three will be preparing bids for the 1992 Olympics.Illustrations: photo of Canadian exhibitors",

        "text": "HOUSTON, March 27\u2014 After hours of concern over predicted weather conditions at the landing site, officials of the space agency decided today not to order the space shuttle Columbia back to earth a day early but to proceed with plans for a landing Monday as scheduled.The seven-day test flight of the re-usable winged spaceship is now set to end at 2:27 P.M. Eastern standard time on a desert landing strip at the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico.By going the full duration, the astronauts, Col. Jack R. Lousma of the Marine Corps and Col. C. Gordon Fullerton of the Air Force, will have circumnavigated the earth 115 times, logging 3.4 million miles since their launching last Monday. Improved Weather ForecastThe decision to adhere to the original flight plan was announced early this afternoon on the basis of new weather reports indicating that the clouds and gusty winds at White Sands should move out of the area by Monday. The forecast is for high-altitude clouds, light breezy winds and only occasional gusts.At a news conference this afternoon, Harold M. Draughon, a flight director, said, ''At the present time, we have every intention of having the end of the mission Monday.''Earlier, flight controllers said that a Sunday landing was a strong possibility. They feared that a low-pressure system, now over southern California, would intensify and, according to computer projections, move rapidly over the Southwest, carrying more clouds and winds to the landing site.But the decision to land Monday was announced after the regular morning meeting of project managers by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.Flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center here said that they still had the option of extending the mission an extra day, until Tuesday, if the weather changed and created unfavorable landing conditions Monday. The spaceship's supplies of fuel, power and breathing gases are more than adequate for such an extension, the controllers said.Project officials said that the failed communications links from the Columbia to earth were not a consideration when the possibility of an early return was raised.Three links in the S-band communications system for transmitting computer data and voice messages became inoperable Thursday night. The source of the trouble remains a mystery, flight engineers said. But no further problems have cropped up and normal communications are being maintained through backup modes.The astronauts were informed of the landing decision as they worked on scientific experiments and maneuvers testing how well the Columbia travels. With few exceptions, Mr. Draughon said, the astronauts have accomplished nearly all their mission objectives.Despite the rash of mechanical glitches, he said, ''The mission really has been extremely successful.'' More Stability on ShuttleAs the sixth day of the mission got under way, both the spaceship and the astronauts appeared to be in more stable condition than at any time since it was sent up Monday.There was only one new malfunction, involving a scientific instrument. A motor that drives a sensor in the solar ultraviolet monitor failed this morning as the astronauts began a period of sun observations. Scientists said they still expected to get useful data in one wavelength of the ultraviolet spectrum.This instrument and another, to measure X-rays from solar flares, were operated through much of the day. The astronauts fired small steering rockets to reorient the spaceship so that its cargo bay, holding the instruments, was facing the sun. The Columbia had been traveling with its nose pointed to the sun, one of several positions for tests of the effects of extreme solar heating on the shuttle's systems.Otherwise, the Columbia's condition remained much the same as it has been for several days. Besides the difficulties with the communications links, about 40 heat-protection tiles were missing from the shuttle's exterior, but not in especially critical areas. The toilet was still giving the astronauts trouble. The power generator that overheated in the launching, one of three redundant units, remained questionable, though the return-to-landing maneuvers could easily be accomplished without it.Even one of the spaceship's earlier problems, an occasional leak in the nitrogen gas plumbing, has been corrected. Flight engineers detected the source of the slow leak and rerouted the gas flow to bypass it. Like many of the malfunctions, the leak had not been considered serious. Adjusting to OrbitColonel Lousma and Colonel Fullerton seemed to be adjusting better to life in orbit; their difficulties with fatigue and motion sickness were largely behind them.''We really feel good,'' Colonel Lousma said once. ''We're really enjoying it.'' Today's wake-up call to the astronauts came at 6:30 A.M. while the Columbia was passing within range of the Yarragadee tracking station in Australia. They were on their 78th revolution of the earth.Instead of loud music from Mission Control, in the usual spirit of wake-up calls, the astronauts were treated to brief messages from their wives and children.Mary Lousma, 13 years old, asked, ''How'd you sleep last night, Dad? I sleep with my eyes closed.'' Gratia Lousma, the commander's wife, said, ''We don't want you to get too comfortable up there and decide to stay.'' Andrew Fullerton, 6, told his father to ''look out and see Texas, and I'll be waving at you.'' Unworldly SensationsColonel Fullerton described one of the unworldly sensations of waking up in orbit, saying: ''It was beautiful, sunny as the alarm went off, and we pulled up the window shade and looked out there. About halfway through the pass, the sun went down, and now it's black as night.''At their altitude of more than 150 miles, the astronauts circle the earth once every 89 minutes, day and night, one sunrise and sunset after another.But in other ways, the morning hours aboard the Columbia included some down-home touches. The astronauts shaved and made breakfast. They read the ''morning newspaper,'' which is what Colonel Lousma called the messages received overnight on their teleprinter in which Mission Control alerts them to revisions in the flight plan for the new day.''I noticed that it gets longer and longer to read it these days,'' Colonel Fullerton remarked. Then, while Colonel Lousma re-aligned the Columbia's guidance systems and purged the electricity-generating fuel cells, usual morning chores, Colonel Fullerton went about the unenviable task of stowing trash and cleaning the waste collection system, the engineering name for the toilet.The astronauts reported that they had been having some trouble with their plastic juice bottles. This morning, they said, a third bottle split, creating a nuisance. A Run on a TreadmillLater, for the orbital equivalent of a brisk jog in the park, the two astronauts took turns running on a treadmill. All this was in preparation for a fairly busy day of spacecraft tests and scientific observations. On board, either on the deck below the cockpit or in the cargo bay, are about 21,000 pounds of scientific instruments, the largest load to be carried so far on a shuttle flight. The cargo bay is capable of holding 65,000 pounds.In a telecast from the Columbia this morning, the astronauts again showed the case holding bees, flies and moths, the insect-motion experiment designed by Todd Nelson, an 18-year-old high school senior from Minnesota.''Question for Todd,'' joked Colonel Fullerton. ''Where do we look for the honey? Like to have it for breakfast tomorrow.''Illustrations: photo of Lee Briscoe at space center in Houston photo of Col. Jack R. Lousma, Col. C. Gordon Fullerton",

For now, they\u2019re all leaving Japan alone.The three largest credit rating agencies have said that it\u2019s too early to decide whether the recent earthquake will lead to downgrades for Japanese sovereign debt. Fitch rates Japan AA, S&P AA-, and Moody\u2019s Aa2 and all three will remain unchanged for now.The announcements may help keep a debt crisis at bay in Japan, as the country grapples with the mounting problems created by the last week\u2019s series of natural disasters.Workers are fighting to prevent a nuclear meltdown, the death toll is rising, and energy and food shortages are rippling across the nation. Moody\u2019s notes that Prime Minister Kan was quoted in the Nikkei News as saying that the earthquake and tsunami created \u201cthe biggest crisis facing the country since World War II.\u201d\u201cThe shock from Friday\u2019s earthquake does not make a fiscal crisis in Japan imminent,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote in its recent report, a sentiment echoed by Fitch and S&P. \u201cWe recognize that the immediate focus of the government must be on emergency relief and reconstruction efforts, no matter what the fiscal cost.\u201dBefore the earthquake, some hedge funds had wagered on a Japanese financial collapse, saying that the country would have to default on its massive debt (predicted to hit 228% of GDP this year) or destroy the value of the yen. In the past week, the debate about Japan\u2019s fiscal health has returned, with Japan bears pointing to the fact that the government will be forced to borrow even more money to pay for rescue and reconstruction work.Any downgrade of Japanese sovereign debt would certainly increase the likelihood of a debt crisis. While the agencies are adamant that their ratings are mere opinions, ratings often dictate whether large institutional investors can hold a bond (or must be forced to sell). Downgrades can also be trigger events in financial contracts, like credit default swaps, that force money to change hands between parties; and they have historically spooked markets. The decision to downgrade AIG AIG amid the financial crisis is a perfect example of a rating action having a real and disastrous impact.In the case of Japan, the agencies all say that they have faith in the country\u2019s ability to raise money as needed, and will take no action in the near term. They add that reconstruction will create future economic activity that could offset those borrowing costs.Fitch warns that the rapid increase in the public debt burden will make it that much more important for Japan to come up with a credible plan to balance the budget and deal with its debt load. Fitch added that it would consider putting the country on negative watch if a \u201csustained rise in [Japanese Government Bond] yields\u2026 worsened the sovereign\u2019s debt dynamics.\u201d Because Japan has such a large debt, it can\u2019t afford even a small rise in interest payments.Moody\u2019s agrees, saying that \u201ca tipping point may be reached\u201d if the market starts to sell JGBs and yields rise.However, Japan has long borrowed money from its own people and institutions, which has kept interest rates low and markets stable. S&P believes that the country will continue to be able to issue additional debt \u201cwithout a major increase in risk premiums, and does not expect major capital outflows.\u201cThis supposition will, of course, be tested,\u201d S&P wrote in its note.",

Near-term oscillators continue to point to the bearish side, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) still capped below 50 and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) line remaining under the signal and zero line,\" IG's market strategist Bernard Aw wrote in a note released Tuesday, adding that the 50-day moving average at S$0.828 will act as a \"formidable barrier\" for the stock.A dead cat bounce is a short-lived rally, often caused by short-covering, in a stock suffering from a prolonged decline.Most importantly, Aw said that weak underlying fundamentals remained the key obstacles for a recovery in the battered stock.\"The reality is that Noble is under pressure from several fronts, including a falling profit margin, a slowdown in commodity trading as well as issues relating to corporate governance and transparency. Piecemeal measures such as share buybacks are unlikely to relieve the downward pressure as long as the backdrop does not improve substantially,\" Aw said.For CMC Markets' Nicholas Teo, the sustainability of the rebound depends on how aggressive Noble Group is with their share purchases.\"The rebound is relative on how much more the company wants to buy since they have in their authority to buy up to 673 million shares based on their filing. The shares they have bought thus far, with no pun intended, is only the tip of the iceberg,\" the Singapore-based analyst told CNBC by phone. Noble Group now holds more than 62 million shares by way of market acquisition.\"The aggressive buying has shown a floor in the share price and markets recognize that, regardless of whether the rebound is sustainable or not, so short sellers may not be so keen now. But the rebound above S$0.70 may also allow short sellers to have the opportunity to have another kick in the can,\" Teo added.Shares of Noble Group have lost about 40 percent since February when anonymous group Iceberg Research released a series of critical reports on the Hong Kong trader's accounting practices. U.S. short seller Muddy Waters dealt another blow to the company in April after saying it had taken a short position on the stock.Last week, S&P downgraded the company's rating outlook to negative from stable, citing that the higher risk nature of Noble's trading positions could result in more volatile earnings and profitability for the company.",

After a dismal performance last week, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is struggling to climb back from a sharp early Monday drop, while markets all around the world have endured big losses.What\u2019s shaking investor confidence? In a word, China, where weak economic numbers and some increasingly desperate interventions by the state have awakened investors to the possibility of a painful slowdown.Add in concerns about how malaise in China could hurt other developing countries, plus fears that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has lost its patience for necessary stimulus, and you have all the ingredients for a global sell-off.For decades now, economic growth in China has been fiery, often reaching rates above 10 percent.But those heady days of consistent, high-octane growth seem to be over. In the first half of 2015, China\u2019s growth rate was 7 percent, and that\u2019s if you believe the official numbers (for comparison, a recent independent analysis found that the true unemployment rate in China may be nearly three times the official rate).The slump is part of a global wave of selling triggered by increased signs of an economic slowdown in China.Fears were stoked earlier this month when China removed some of the limits on currency trading and the value of the yuan fell substantially. Even though the Chinese government was probably hoping for the yuan to lose some value, investors interpreted the drop as a sign of weakness.That\u2019s because China was supposed to be moving past the export-first phase of its development \u2014 no longer just a place for companies to make cheap products, but a mature consumer market where companies from around the world can sell their goods to the growing Chinese middle class.Also disconcerting was the way the Chinese government handled its July stock market collapse, where it intervened aggressively to prop up stock prices, suggesting that it isn\u2019t ready to let markets operate on their own.It\u2019s important not to exaggerate the connection between market fluctuations and events around the world. There\u2019s a lot of unpredictability in market movements, and it\u2019s often impossible to tease out the deeper forces driving markets.But here\u2019s how the slowdown in China might be feeding the current troubles.The most basic reason stock prices fall is because investors start to think \u2014 or fear \u2014 that companies are going to perform worse than previously anticipated. And if China is facing a severe economic slowdown \u2014 one that could hamper the development of a robust Chinese consumer class \u2014 some companies would indeed have a smaller market for their goods. That means lower profits, less money to share with investors, and lower stock prices.China is far from the only thing weighing down markets. Other concerns include:\u25a0 Contagion: If China\u2019s economy really is slowing, lots of other countries will suffer alongside. As an example, a slowing China would probably need less oil, driving down oil prices and hurting oil-dependent economies like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.\u25a0 Rising interest rates: For months the Federal Reserve has been preparing investors for a hike in interest rates. But the point of raising rates is to keep the US economy from overheating. And with China\u2019s slowdown threatening the US economy, the big challenge may be to heat the economy back up, not cool it down.\u25a0 An overdue correction: The stock market has been outperforming the US economy ever since the Great Recession. There\u2019s some good reason for that, including the fact that corporate profits have been particularly strong. But the market can only run so far ahead of the real economy before some kind of correction sets in. And that may be what we\u2019re seeing now.Sometimes a sharp downturn in the markets is followed by an equally sharp recovery. Other times, there\u2019s no such rapid rebound. After the black Monday sell-off in 1987, it took more than a year for the S&P 500 to recoup its losses. After the tech bubble burst in 2000, it took about six years.One hopeful precedent is the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which swept through much of southeast Asia and initially sent the US stock market tumbling. Within a few months, all those losses had been recouped.Then again, in 1997 China was largely insulated from Asia\u2019s economic troubles. That\u2019s not true this time around, and it could mean a wider fallout, a slower recovery, and possibly some spillover from a stock market crisis into a full-on economic downturn.",

In one of the funniest scenes, it looks like the band's plane may crash, and confessions come out left and right. Easily the best of them is Stillwater member Ed (John Fedevich) announcing \"I'm gay!\" Moments later, the turbulence ceases, and every one shambles off the plane, unable to retract the things they said.While Deschanel technically made her film debut in 1999, most movie-goers first met her in, in which she plays a mod stewardess and the older sister to Fugit's character.

And, with house building falling to an 87-year low, just three housing schemes were granted awards.Many of the country's leading designers, including Zaha Hadid, David Chipperfield and Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, won accolades for buildings elsewhere in the EU rather than at home. Hadid's expressionist angles and curves were reserved for Rome's museum of 21st-century art, MAXXI, while Lord Rogers, widely regarded as one of the world's leading modernists, designed a new headquarters campus for a Spanish technology company in Seville.\"The RIBA awards reflect not only the state of British architecture but also that of its economy,\" said Ruth Reed, the institute's president. \"In the midst of the deepest recession in the awards' 45-year history, this year demonstrates that, although times might be hard for architects, there are still great buildings being built throughout the country and overseas. The RIBA awards always give an opportunity for gem-like small projects and less established practices to shine through, and this year is no exception. Far from being a size prize, the RIBA awards are for buildings that offer value to people's lives.\"The memorial in Hyde Park to the victims of the 7 July 2005 bomb attacks on the London transport network, by Carmody Groarke, also won and is considered by some as a possible contender for the shortlist for the \u00a320,000 Stirling prize for building of the year, which is drawn from the RIBA award winners.Ellis Woodman, architecture critic at the newspaper Building Design, said that other strong Stirling prize contenders included the Nottingham contemporary arts centre, the new British embassy in Warsaw, the Neues Museum in Berlin, Christ's College school in Guildford and Hadid's MAXXI museum.The Oregon-born architect Rick Mather won most awards, gaining four. Other winning buildings included a new home in Bristol for Wallace and Gromit's creators, Aardman Animations, and a cluster of foil-clad small-business units, which look like cybermen helmets, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, in Wales.",

Martin Clayton, curator of the exhibition \u2013 which will open in the Queen's Gallery at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh to coincide with the Edinburgh festival, and run on until mid-November \u2013 believes his work on anatomy could have transformed medical knowledge, but the results remained in his own notebooks until his death in 1519. He had intended to publish a major treatise but, like so much of his work, it was never completed as he was constantly distracted by new projects.All the drawings had been imported into England by the 17th century, bound into an album which was probably bought by Charles II, and have been in the Royal Collection since at least 1690.Some of the anatomical drawings were exhibited in the Queen's Gallery in London last year, but the Edinburgh show will be the first to compare Leonardo's results with scalpel and pen with the best results of modern technology.Clayton said: \"For the first time we will be displaying the artist's works alongside stunning examples of medical imaging, showing how the concerns and methods of the world's leading anatomists have changed little in 500 years, and how truly groundbreaking Leonardo's work was.The exhibition will show how close Leonardo got in some of his last medical experiments to discovering the role of the beating heart in the circulation of the blood, a century before William Harvey worked it out.In 1508 he dissected a 100-year-old man, and recorded accurately for the first time cirrhosis of the liver, and narrowing of the arteries. In the winter of 1510-11 he worked with the professor of anatomy dissecting 20 corpses in the medical school of Pavia, and covered his sheets of paper with multi-layered drawings from different angles of almost every bone in the human body including the first accurate depiction of the spine, and many of the major muscle groups.One of the more famous drawings in the collection, of a baby in the womb \u2013 partly based on his dissection of a pregnant cow \u2013 will be displayed beside a 3D ultrasound scan of a foetus.His drawings of a hand, beginning with the bones, adding the deep muscles of the palm and then the layers of tendons, will be displayed beside a film of a dissected hand in high definition 3D. His studies of the muscles of the shoulder and arm will also be compared with an animation of the same sequence, and a 3D film of a dissected shoulder which confirms the startling accuracy he achieved.\u2022 Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man, Queen's Gallery Holyroodhouse, 2 August \u2013 10 November 2013",

Was she, as well as being collaborator and muse for Nam June Paik in his revolutionary mixed-media pieces, also his stooge?These questions were debated in New York\u2019s downtown artistic circles (especially by feminists) when she was alive. And they are quietly raised again in the celebratory exhibition and catalog \u201cA Feast of Astonishments: Charlotte Moorman and the Avant-Garde, 1960s-1980s\u201d at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University, as well as in Joan Rothfuss \u2019s entertaining new biography, \u201cTopless Cellist: The Improbable Life of Charlotte Moorman.\u201dAccording to Ms. Rothfuss\u2019s research, Moorman could have enjoyed a normal middle-class American life. Growing up in Little Rock, Ark., an only child who studied music and won the \u201cMiss City Beautiful\u201d contest at age 19, she was not a born rebel. Even after her move in 1957 to New York, where she attended the Juilliard School for a year and married a double-bassist, she envisioned herself playing cello in an orchestra or string ensemble.But performing the classics, Moorman decided, was a bore compared to the offerings in New York\u2019s experimental music and art scene during the \u201960s. Her marriage annulled, she took up with a series of male mentors. (She ended up happily paired with the visual artist Frank Pileggi. )An eccentric who never threw anything away, Moorman has left the show\u2019s six curators\u2014one of whom is Ms. Rothfuss\u2014with almost too much material to sift in presenting her flamboyant life. (Northwestern bought the artist\u2019s archive and has been organizing it since 2001.)In addition to photographs of her in many productions, the exhibition has museum loans of Paik\u2019s video sculptures and a program of films and videos that shows her playing works by Paik (\u201cSonata for Adults Only\u201d) and others. There are cellos that Moorman fashioned, in neon or from syringes (used for her cancer treatments), as well as the felt-covered instrument that Joseph Beuys made for her to use in one of his works.Annotated scores of music she performed by New York\u2019s avant-garde ( John Cage, Ornette Coleman, Paik) are here, along with her copy of Karlheinz Stockhausen \u2019s \u201cOriginale (Originals),\u201d a piece from 1964 in which she played the part of the \u201cString Player,\u201d wearing only gauze. Moorman was a key figure in helping these composers to introduce unpredictability, spectacle, danger and humor into the rarefied air of the classical music concert.One way to liberate the audience, Paik believed, was to add nudity. In 1967 Moorman performed half-naked in his \u201cOpera Sextronique\u201d at a theater near Times Square. Arrested for indecent exposure, she spent the night in jail. The tabloid reporting on her trial, which resulted in a suspended sentence, defined her ever after in the public\u2019s mind as the \u201cTopless Cellist,\u201d a label she resented when she wasn\u2019t capitalizing on it.Moorman\u2019s packrat habits have proved invaluable in reconstructing a less well-documented phase of her career: her role as an impresario.In 1963 she founded an annual Festival of the Avant Garde in New York. With almost no resources except her own vivaciousness, she produced it for 15 years, moving it around the city into nontraditional arenas for art and music\u2014Grand Central Terminal, Shea Stadium, Floyd Bennett Field, and the World Trade Center.The walls and cases in the exhibition\u2019s second half are papered with her ads and programs for the festivals, supplemented by the photographs of Peter Moore, one of the few who attended all of these ephemeral events. Dozens of composers (Var\u00e8se, Cage, Morton Feldman, Luciano Berio ), filmmakers ( Bruce Conner, Jack Smith ), performance artists and dancers ( Allan Kaprow, Yoko Ono, Dick Higgins, Lucinda Childs ) participated because Moorman cajoled them.She had \u201ca flair for getting EVERYBODY involved, including the more sophisticated who think Charlotte is silly; and she always somehow pulled it off,\u201d wrote the critic Jill Johnston in the Village Voice after one of these festivals.Some feminist artists in the \u201960s and \u201970s were wary of Moorman. Carolee Schneemann thought her a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d and the roster of her festivals was overwhelmingly male.The public was more flummoxed. In a clip here from the Merv Griffin TV show, the studio audience laughs nervously as she holds a string down the back of Jerry Lewis and uses him to perform Paik\u2019s \u201cHuman Cello.\u201dA comedian in her own right, whose friendly smile and Southern accent could disarm most hostile crowds, Moorman knew that just because you weren\u2019t afraid to look ridiculous didn\u2019t mean you weren\u2019t serious.Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.",

        "text": "Bob Beaupre, a laid-off Oracle engineer, performed some yard work for a friend who lent him money.The tech recruiter thought she knew what the Cambridge startup wanted: young software engineers willing to take the risk of working for a company that could just as soon go belly-up as succeed. So that\u2019s who she sent them.But when an executive at the startup showed her the LinkedIn profile of a recent hire, she was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by what she saw: a 60-something man.That\u2019s because many software companies won\u2019t consider veteran candidates, assuming older workers are not up on the latest skills, said Beverly Kahn, president of New Dimensions in Technology in Swampscott. If she recommended workers in their 50s or 60s, she said, \u201cThey would laugh at me, and say \u2018Why are you wasting my time?\u2019\u201dTech workers are in high demand in Massachusetts and around the country as companies grow rapidly and scramble to fill positions. But older tech workers say this hot job market is passing them by. Their phones are not ringing off the hook with calls from recruiters, no six-figure salary offer are being made. Some have been unemployed for months, or longer.Maintaining a career in the rapidly changing tech field can be challenging, industry observers say. A sought-after skill one year can be obsolete the next, requiring workers to stay on top new technologies even if they don\u2019t use them in their jobs.Veteran tech workers say they are frequently told in interviews they are not a \u201cgood fit\u201d for a company\u2019s culture, which they hear as code for \u201ctoo old.\u201d One contract software engineer in Boston said that after he took the first 25 years of experience off his resume, he started getting more interest.Tech is a notoriously youth-oriented culture, from investors saying they prefer startups run by people under the age of 40 to tech workers in Silicon Valley getting plastic surgery to appear younger. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg once famously said -- at the age of 22 -- \u201cYoung people are just smarter.\u201dBrian Halligan, chief executive of the Cambridge software company HubSpot, told the New York Times in 2013 that he likes to hire \u201cyoung kids.\u201d \u201cIn the tech world, gray hair and experience are really overrated,\u201d he said.Dan Lyons, author of an upcoming book about his time working at HubSpot, told the Globe, \u201cIt was abundantly clear that Halligan\u2019s low regard for \u2018experience\u2019 was shared by his 20-something middle managers.\u201d Halligan responded in an email that HubSpot hires veteran and inexperienced workers alike \u201cwho are driven by purpose and seek to challenge the status quo.\u201dBut there\u2019s no denying the tech industry skews young. The median age of workers at Facebook in 2014 was 29, according to the Seattle salary data and software company PayScale Inc. At Amazon and Google, it\u2019s 30. The median age of all American workers according to Labor Department: 42.Being unemployed in your 50s and 60s is tough in any industry. It takes longer to find a job \u2013 around 45 percent of job seekers 55 and older are out of work for 27 weeks or longer, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to about 34 percent for those who are younger. When older people do find work, they often make less money. Nearly half of people between the ages of 45 and 70 surveyed by the AARP were earning less at new jobs than they were before they became unemployed.Companies may be less inclined to hire people in their late 40s and beyond because they assume older candidates will want more money and won\u2019t be willing to work long hours, tech industry analysts said. Age discrimination is illegal, of course, and rarely blatant, but there are ways around it, analysts said, such as listing \u201cjunior engineer\u201d or \u201cfive years\u2019 experience\u201d on job postings.Bob Beaupre has found that his 21 years of experience are working against him. Since being laid off in June from his $90,000-a-year tech support engineer job at Oracle, Beaupre, 46, has applied for hundreds of positions, with no luck. He said he finds he is either \u201cinstantly overqualified or expected to be an expert on everything.\u201dBeaupre blames himself, in part, for not keeping up with the latest technologies. He is taking classes to add new skills to his resume, but in the meantime, he has had to sell his house in Sutton and do handyman work to get by.He\u2019s also not hopeful about finding another decent job in tech, recently accepting a part-time position at Home Depot for $11 an hour. \u201cI\u2019m almost tempted to just buy a lawn mower and start mowing lawns,\u201d he said.Staying at one job for too long can also work against people in the tech industry, recruiters say. Workers laid off by EMC Corp. in advance of the planned acquisition by Dell Inc. are circulating resumes, many with 10 years or more at the Hopkinton data storage company, one recruiter said. But this kind of longevity creates the risk of a worker being seen as a \u201cdinosaur.\u201dJust hiring workers with the latest skills is \u201calmost a back door to age discrimination,\u201d said Art Papas, the 41-year-old chief executive of the Boston software company Bullhorn Inc.A few years ago, Bullhorn started hiring people based on intelligence and personality tests, rather than specific skills. The result: better software and shorter job vacancies, Papas said.Still, 80 percent of his workforce is under 40.Geography could also play a role in age disparities at local tech companies. A little over a decade ago, when the tech industry was centered along Route 128 and I-495, the vast majority of job openings were in the suburbs. Tech workers who settled in these communities are sometimes reluctant to commute to Boston, said Ben Hicks, a recruiter at WinterWyman of Waltham.But in the past two years, more than two-thirds of local job openings for software engineers were in Boston and Cambridge, according to a WinterWyman analysis.Vanda Collins, a management information systems project management specialist, knows how tricky the hiring process can be for tech veterans. Collins, 50, of Upper Saddle River, N.J., has been out of work for more than a year.She started dying her hair to hide the gray and stopped mentioning her 12-year-old daughter. fearful of a prospective employer thinking she wouldn\u2019t put in late nights. She\u2019s also reluctant to talk about her three college-age kids, afraid she\u2019ll appear too old. It\u2019s a far cry from where she used to be.\u201cWhen I was 35, I was hot,\u201d she said, \u201cI was literally job jumping based on people giving me a call.\u201dPam Tine, 54, considers herself lucky. She landed a contract position a few years ago as a cybersecurity engineer at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford. It helped that she had friends there, and the base employs a number of tech workers in their 50s and older.But it\u2019s frustrating to be in an industry that doesn\u2019t seem to value older people, Tine said. As he put it, \u201cI don\u2019t exactly think Google is going to be interested in me.\u201d",

Back when another candidate, some guy associated with a magazine that competes against Fortune, advocated a flat tax, I always thought it was a kooky idea. Now, after doing a modicum of reporting on tax policy, I\u2019m not so sure the idea is so crazy.To be clear, it\u2019ll never happen. At least not by Fred Thompson, not in our lifetimes and not in this country. We can\u2019t even support immigration or social security reform, issues that ought to have bipartisan support. We certainly can\u2019t amicably trash the entire tax code \u2014 even if it deserves to be trashed.So why am I praising, if faintly, a flat tax? For the simple reason that a flat tax would throw oodles of sneaky tax attorneys, accountants and other deadbeat schemers out of work. Earlier in the year, when I was writing about attempts to change the way private-equity funds are taxed, I spent hours on the phone and in meetings with tax lawyers. It becomes fairly clear fairly quickly that if these bright and energetic people somehow could find employment that actually made a contribution to the national good we\u2019d be a much better place overall. As it is, they are just bottom-feeders, pushing up the cost of doing business, hopelessly confusing matters and making it easier for the those with the most resources to minimize their tax bills. I wonder just how many tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans spend their working hours trying to help indviduals and companies cheat the U.S. government out of its tax revenues. Does anyone know?Don\u2019t look to Thompson for answers. Congress has estimated that a plan similar to his would cost the Treasury at least $2.5 trillion over 10 years, according to a report Monday in the New York Times.I have no idea if a well designed flat tax could succeed in balancing the budget.

        "text": "NEW HAVEN, April 27\u2014 Vincent Scully did not want to retire, but Yale University insisted, and so it was time for the last lecture of the class he started teaching in 1947. He was not expecting it to be all that different from the others until he arrived on Friday to see that the audience more or less constituted the course title: Modern Architecture.Sitting there among the freshmen taking the introductory course was Philip Johnson, 85 years old, the designer of the A.T. & T. Building and so much else. Not far away was Maya Lin, 31, who designed the Vietnam War Memorial during her senior year at Yale in 1981. Scattered around the auditorium were dozens of other architects somewhere in between those two ages.Their presence was probably best explained by David M. Childs, who is working on two of the largest current projects in Manhattan, at Columbus Circle and on Donald J. Trump's land along the Hudson River. Mr. Childs could not make it on Friday -- he was busy on a building in Brussels -- but he sent along a letter:\"Thirty years ago a sophomore pre-med student went to listen to a 53b lecture. One hour later, he decided to switch to a major in architecture. Thank you for changing my life.\"Mr. Scully took one look at the assemblage of architects, walked out the door to compose his thoughts and then came back to the stage. \"It's very hard to begin,\" he said. \"I'm simply very intimidated.\" But then the lights went out, the slides came on and he was in his element.Mr. Scully has put forth his theories in many media -- 15 books, countless articles, a series of public television programs that he narrated -- but it was his course lectures that made him, in Philip Johnson's words, \"the most influential architecture teacher ever.\" The lectures consistently attracted hundreds of students, many not even taking the class, and they customarily ended with ovations.The last one began quietly with talk about \"contextuality\" and \"healing the wounds that the modern age has inflicted upon our cities.\" Slides appeared of new towns built during the last three decades in the suburbs of Paris -- places with lakes dotted with concrete islands -- and soon he was waving the wooden pointer in exasperation and rolling along in passionate cadences.\"They are without question . . . the most degraded setting for human life that mankind has ever managed to throw together,\" he said. \"So utterly and completely degraded. So utterly without any order, without community, without a sense of neighborhood. In some of these there aren't even any sidewalks.\"There were sounds in the audience. Mr. Scully had them moaning about sidewalks. He pointed to a row of houses covered with solar panels.\"Here is a fellow who wanted to do something about solar energy. So everything about his house has to do with the reception of light. What it does, of course, is utterly destroy the building's presence on the street.\" The architect had forgotten about \"buildings all getting along with each other.\"\"It looks like a world that's been chewed by rats,\" he said, and asked how a people who built Paris could have gone so wrong.The answer came when pictures of another development appeared. Mr. Scully happened to be in some of the pictures, and he acknowledged his presence to be a lamentable distraction, but he explained, \"That's because they were taken by my wife, who, not being an architect, feels that human beings should be in the picture, too.\"The audience applauded, and afterward the visiting architects said the sentiment probably summed up Mr. Scully's career as well as anything.\"He gave you the feeling that architects should make a positive difference in people's lives,\" said Ms. Lin. \"He gave you a feeling of social responsibility, and it influenced me when I did the Vietnam Memorial. I wanted to do something that dealt not with politics or glory but that focused on individuals' experience.\"Mr. Scully was an early champion of historic preservation and crusaded against 1960's urban redevelopment schemes, particularly in New Haven, where he was born 70 years ago. He championed the work of Robert Venturi in the revolt against abstract modernism -- the glass boxes on the Avenue of the Americas -- which culminated in post-modern structures like Mr. Johnson's A.T. & T. Building. 'We All Want to Please Vince'\"His magnetic personality persuaded me time and time again,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"He opened our eyes.\"The visiting architects represented a wide variety of styles and buildings -- Cesar Pelli and the World Financial Center, Kevin Roche's wings at the Metropolitan Museum, Leon Krier and the new villages designed for Prince Charles -- but they had one thing in common, said Robert A. M. Stern.\"In some deep nefarious way we all want to please Vince,\" said Mr. Stern, whose shingle-style houses in the Hamptoms were inspired by \"The Shingle Style and the Stick Style,\" a book by Mr. Scully published in 1955. \"He's a high moralist, and he keeps reminding us of the high standards we have to live up to.\"Mr. Scully seemed uncomfortable with both their praise and with being honored upon his retirement. He had wanted to keep teaching, but Yale has mandatory retirement at age 70. He will have an emeritus position next year, in which he will teach a class, but not his famous introduction to modern architecture.How did he feel when he got his first glimpse of the visiting architects?\"It was too much,\" he said. \"One wants to get through the last lecture without inflicting some terrible psychodrama of aging on the students. I was just hoping these guys don't break me down.\"Photo: Vincent Scully receiving a standing ovation Friday night after his final lecture in Modern Architecture, a class he has been teaching since 1947 at Yale University.

        "text": "On May 2, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sat down for an exclusive two-hour interview with TIME editor Nancy Gibbs, Asia editor Zoher Abdoolcarim and South Asia bureau chief Nikhil Kumar in New Delhi. Speaking mostly in Hindi, Modi talked about everything from his ambitions for India to the global war on terrorism to what personally moves him. Translated and condensed highlights, followed by the full interview:On what he has learned so far about \u00adrunning India: The biggest challenge was that I was new to the federal government structures. Different departments tend to work in silos\u2014each department seems to [be] a government in itself. My effort has been to break these silos down, [so that] everybody \u2026 looks at a problem in a collective manner. I see the federal government not as an assembled entity but as an organic entity.On how he sees the U.S.: We are natural allies \u2026 [It\u2019s not] what India can do for the U.S., what the U.S. can do for India \u2026 The way we should look at it is what India and the U.S. can together do for the world \u2026 strengthening democratic values all over.On India\u2019s sometimes tense relations with China: For nearly three decades there has been, by and large, peace and tranquility on the India-China border. Not a single bullet has been fired for over a quarter-century. Both countries are showing great maturity and a commitment to economic cooperation.On the possibility of the Taliban\u2019s returning to power in Afghanistan: The drawdown of U.S. troops is, of course, an independent decision of the American government, but in the interest of a stable government in Afghanistan, it would be important to hold consultations with the Afghan government to understand their security needs as the U.S. troops draw down.On tackling the threat of terrorism: We should not look at terrorism from the nameplates\u2014\u00adwhich group they belong to, what is their geographical location, who are the victims. These individual groups or names will keep changing. Today you are looking at the Taliban or ISIS; tomorrow you might be looking at another name.We should pass the U.N.\u2019s Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. At least it will clearly establish whom you view as a terrorist and whom you don\u2019t. We need to delink terrorism from religion\u2014to isolate terrorists who use this interchange of arguments between terrorism and religion.Several countries used to see terrorism as a law-and-order situation of individual countries. We should see it as something that is a fight for human values.On whether economic reforms have gone far and fast enough: [This time] last year, nothing seemed to be happening in the government. There seemed to be a complete policy paralysis \u2026 There was no leadership. My government\u2019s coming to power should be viewed in the context of the developments of the 10 years of the last government vs. 10 months of my government \u2026 The whole world is, once again, excited and enthusiastic about India and the opportunities that India represents. Whether it is the IMF, the World Bank, Moody\u2019s or other credit agencies, they are all saying in one voice that India has a great economic future.(Read TIME\u2019s cover story about Narendra Modi)On whether he would like to have the kind of authoritarian power that China\u2019s leader has: India is a democracy; it is in our DNA. As far as the different political parties are concerned, I firmly believe that they have the maturity and wisdom to make decisions that are in the best interests of the nation. So if you were to ask me whether you need a dictatorship to run India, No, you do not. Whether you need a powerful person who believes in concentrating power, No, you do not. If you were to ask me to choose between democratic values and wealth, power, prosperity and fame, I will very easily and without any doubt choose democratic values.On India\u2019s religious diversity, which some citizens believe is under siege: My philosophy, the philosophy of my party and the philosophy of my government is Sabka saath, sabka vikas\u2014\u201cTogether with all, progress for all.\u201d Take everybody together and move toward inclusive growth. Wherever a [negative] view might have been expressed [about] a minority religion, we have immediately negated that. So far as the government is concerned, there is \u00adonly one holy book, which is the constitution of India. The unity and the integrity of the country are the topmost priorities. All religions and all communities have the same rights, and it is my responsibility to ensure their complete and total protection. My government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.On what influences him: [Chokes and tears up.] This touches my deepest core. I was born in a very poor family. I used to sell tea in a railway coach as a child. My mother used to wash utensils and do lowly household work in the houses of others to earn a livelihood. I have seen poverty very closely. I have lived in poverty. As a child, my entire childhood was steeped in poverty. For me, poverty, in a way, was the first inspiration of my life \u2026 I decided that I would not live for myself but would live for others.Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi: Welcome to India, first of all. This is your first visit to India and I am delighted that on your very first visit we have a chance to meet. I hope this opportunity, this visit of yours, will also provide you an occasion to return to India more often.TIME: Thank you, we hope so as well. I should start by wishing you a happy anniversary. It is almost one year now in office. So, I am curious about what has surprised you most. You often talked about being an outsider. Now that you are the ultimate insider, what have you seen about the strengths and the opportunities and the obstacles that you face in the program that you are hoping to pursue?Modi: For more than forty years now, I have had an opportunity and chance to travel all across India. There would perhaps be more than 400 districts of India where I have spent a night. So I am fully aware of the strengths of India, I am fully aware of the challenges that we face, I am not unaware of them. What was relatively new to me was the Federal government structures, the systems, the way we operate at the Federal level. That was a part which I was not aware of till I entered the government here.The biggest challenge I think was that I was new to the Federal government structures. They were new to me, I was new to them, so there was a question of understanding each other\u2019s perspective. But within a very short time I have bridged the gap through very focused and concentrated actions. There is now a meeting of minds. I understand them very well, they understand me very well. Because of that, within a very short period of time, we have been able to establish a smooth, seamless working mechanism within the Federal structure.I was Chief Minister of the State of Gujarat for a long period of time. I knew very well what the Central government thought about the States of India and what State governments thought of the Federal government. I wanted to change this thought process, the fundamental thought process as to how the Federal Government and the State governments perceive each other. I wanted the Federal Government and the State Governments to work together for the country. I basically wanted to bring about a complete change in the thinking that Federal government is a giver to the State government, and the State government is a recipient of the largesse from the Federal government. And I think within a very short period of time, I have managed to achieve that objective to a very large extent.I coined a term for that, which I call cooperative Federalism. I took it actually a step further and called it cooperative competitive Federalism. Essentially the concept is that it would encourage different State governments to compete with each other for the growth of the country. What essentially I have tried to do, and I think we have managed to do that, is to convert the country from a single-pillar growth nation to a nation that has 30 pillars of growth; these are the 29 States of India and the Federal centre.Similarly, it was my experience after I entered the Federal government that different departments of the Government of India tend to work in silos. Each department seems to work as a Government in itself. The reason for that is that for the last three decades, there has not been a majority government at the Federal level; there have essentially been coalition governments, which has had a major impact on the government systems which created silos. My effort has been to ensure that these silos get broken down, that there is a collective thought process which is brought about in the Federal government. And I think we have managed to achieve that in a short period of time wherein everybody thinks together as a collective, everybody works together. And also it has invigorated the administrative system of the Federal government which looks at a problem in a collective manner rather than as individual silos.I see the Federal government not as an assembled entity but as an organic entity so that each one understands the problems of the other and can collectively work together to address those problems.(PHOTOS: Behind TIME\u2019s Cover With Narendra Modi)TIME: Moving on to the US, the US-India relationship, President Obama has spoken very highly of you including on the Time 100 very recently. As you go transforming India, transforming the government as you say, how do you think the US should see you \u2013 as a partner, as an economic competitor? Would \u201cMake in India\u201d for example mean that jobs from the US would come here? So, the debate that we had on the service sector, would that not switch to manufacturing sector? How should the US see you?Modi: I am extremely grateful to President Obama for the thoughtful and generous manner in which he has described me. What he has written in TIME magazine recently, I am also very grateful to him.If I have to describe the India-US relationship in a single word, I will say we are natural allies. I think the relationship between India and US, and the two countries in themselves, have played an enormously important role and continue to play an important role in strengthening democratic values all over the world.What should the India-US relationship be, what India can do for the US, what the US can do for India, I think that is a rather limited point of view to take. I think the way we should look at it is what India and the US can together do for the world. That is the perspective in which we approach our relationship with the United States.(Read Barack Obama\u2019s tribute to Narendra Modi)TIME: You have visited 16 countries already in this year. Who would you say are your other natural allies?Modi: I think this is an expected question from a journalistic point of view! I think each country has its own importance and each relationship has to be viewed in its own perspective. There are several countries of the world with which India has strategic partnerships. There are several other countries with which we have a relationship that is comprehensive in some other respects. There are some which are perhaps born to be there as natural allies, but there are still gaps to be covered in order for us to become natural allies. So I think it is important for us to see each relationship in an overall perspective and also how India approaches that relationship with each country.If you look at the India-US relationship for example, the role that the Indian diaspora has played in the relationship is extremely crucial. Yes, we share democratic values but there is also the great role that the Indian diaspora has played in strengthening the bond of friendship between India and the US, and of course in underscoring the democratic values between the two countries.Also our worldview\u2026 in addition to our shared democratic values, there are convergences in our worldview on different situations in the world. So, if I were to describe the relationship with other countries, I would say that each relationship of India with other countries has to be seen in a context and a perspective that is different from each other.TIME: Prime Minister, you will be visiting China very soon. China is increasingly assertive and influential on the world stage including in the South Asia region. China and India have fought a border war before, and sometimes the relationship, the atmosphere can be tense. With your visit to China and your meeting with China\u2019s leaders, what kind of relationship do you want to forge with China? Do you think you can do business with China\u2019s leaders? Can India and China ever be friends?Modi: After the India-China war in 1962, in the early 90s, India and China agreed on a framework for peace and tranquillity on the border. Further, since nearly last three decades until this time that we have entered into the 21st century, there is by and large peace and tranquillity on the India-China border. It is not a volatile border. Not a single bullet has been fired for over a quarter of a century now. This essentially goes to prove that both countries have learnt from history.In so far as the India-China relationship is concerned specifically, it is true that there is a long border between India and China and a large part of it is disputed. Still, I think both countries have shown great maturity in the last couple of decades to ensure and commit to economic cooperation which has continued to grow over the last 20 to 30 years to a stage where we currently have an extensive trade, investment and project related engagement between the two countries. Given the current economic situation in the world, we are at a stage where we cooperate with China at the international stage but we also compete with China when it comes to commerce and trade.You referred to the increase in Chinese influence in the region and in the world. I firmly believe that there is not a single country in the world, whether its population is one million or much more, which would not want to increase its influence internationally. I think it is a very natural tendency for the nations to increase their influence in the international space, as they pursue their international relations with different countries. I firmly believe that with due regard to international rules and regulations, and with full respect for human values, I think with these two perspectives in mind each country has the right to increase its presence, its impact and influence internationally for the benefit of the global community.TIME: I just wanted to ask a follow-up question. On the eve of your visit to China, would you wish to send a special message to President Xi? Would you like to say something to him on the eve of your visit?Modi: I firmly believe that the relationship between two countries, the India-China relationship as you are referring to, should be such that to communicate with each other there should really not be a need for us to go through a third entity. That is the level of relationship that we currently have.TIME: The US is gradually drawing down its forces in Afghanistan. I am wondering whether you worry about the Taliban returning to power, and about the threat from ISIS and how you see that.Modi: There are two different perspectives to the question that you asked and I would try and answer each of those two separately. The first refers to the India-Afghanistan relationship. It is well known that India and Afghanistan have enjoyed ancient ties and a very close relationship. People talk of infrastructure development these days. But if you go back in history, you\u2019ll see that one of the former kings in the region Sher Shah Suri is the one who built the Kolkata-Kabul Grand Trunk Road.The closeness of the India-Afghanistan relationship is not a new phenomenon. It has existed since time immemorial. And as a close friend, ever since India\u2019s Independence, we have done and will continue to do whatever is required to be done to see Afghanistan grow and progress as a close friend.President Ashraf Ghani was here last week. We had a good meeting and extensive discussions. One of the key points of discussions was the roadmap for development and progress in Afghanistan. We have in the past committed extensively to that. In fact, India\u2019s assistance to Afghanistan is close to about 2.2 billion dollars for reconstruction and development. We have made further commitments to do whatever is required to be done for Afghanistan\u2019s development. And not only have we made commitments, we are also taking concrete and specific steps to implement those commitments.In so far as the drawdown of US troops from Afghanistan is concerned, this is a point on which I had extensive discussions with President Obama when I visited the US in September last year. I mentioned to him that the drawdown of troops is of course an independent decision of the American government, but in the interest of a stable government in Afghanistan, it would be important to hold consultations with the Afghan Government to understand their security needs as the US troops draw down. And I did mention to him that we should all try to meet the security needs of Afghanistan post drawdown of American troops. Rest of course is a decision that is for the US Government to take. But our interest is in ensuring peace and stability in Afghanistan; and whatever is required to be done for that, we will do that.In so far as the Taliban and the ISIS issue which you referred to is concerned, I firmly believe that there is a need for the international community to undertake a detailed introspection of the overall perspective, the way they have looked at terrorism internationally. Till 1993, for example, there were several countries that did not fully understand the full force of this evil. They used to see it and they used to appreciate it purely as a law and order situation of individual countries rather than as an evil force internationally.If you actually analyze the situation closely, what is needed perhaps is for the countries that believe in human values to come together and fight terrorism. We should not look at terrorism from the nameplates \u2013 which group they belong to, what are their names, what is their geographical location, who are the victims of terrorism\u2026I think we should not see them in individual pieces. We should rather have a comprehensive look at the ideology of terrorism, see it as something that is a fight for human values, as terrorists are fighting against humanity.So, all the countries that believe in human values need to come together and fight this evil force as an ideological force, and look at it comprehensively rather than looking at it as Taliban, ISIS, or individual groups or names. These individual groups or names will keep changing. Today you are looking at the Taliban or ISIS; tomorrow you might be looking at another name down the years. So it is important for the countries to go beyond the groups, beyond the individual names, beyond the geographical location they come from, beyond even looking at the victims of the terrorism, and fight terrorism as a unified force and as a collective.TIME: So, what would we do differently if that coming together happened, if we looked at this threat more in the way you are describing; what would change in the way the threat is addressed?Modi: I think as a first step what the international community can definitely look at is passing the United Nations Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism which has been with the United Nations for the last several years. I think that could be the first step for us to take. At least it will clearly establish who you view as terrorist and who you do not view as terrorist. The definitional aspects of terrorism will get addressed.The second thing which is important to do is not to analyze or look at terrorism from a purely political perspective but also view it from the perspective of the way it attacks human values, as a force against humanity, the point that I made earlier on. If you view terrorism in Syria from one perspective and terrorism outside Syria from another perspective, it can create problems. If you view terrorism in categories such as good terrorism and bad terrorism, that too can create its own challenges. Similarly, if you view Taliban as good Taliban or bad Taliban, that creates its own problems.I think we should not look at these questions individually. We should address this problem in one voice, not in segmented voices \u2013 something which diffuses the international focus when it comes to the problem of terrorism. I believe that this can be easily done.I think the other thing that we need to undertake as a focused measure is to delink terrorism from religion. When I met President Obama both in September last year and in January this year, in September last year particularly, I did request him to lead the charge in delinking terrorism from religion. I think if we are able to achieve this and if we go down this path, it would at least put an end to the emotional blackmailing which is inherent in this particular concept. It would also help us additionally to isolate the terrorists completely who tend to use this interchange of arguments between terrorism and religion.Another aspect which is important in our collective fight against terrorism is the question relating to the communication technology, the communication methodology that the terrorists use, and the modes of financing. Terrorists are linked to money laundering, dirty money, drug dealing, arms trafficking. We have to ask ourselves, where do terrorists get their weapons from? Where do they get their communication technology from? Where do they get their financing from? These are some of the aspects where I think the entire international community needs to come together and put a complete stop to access to these three key aspects by the terrorists which assist them in terms of easy access to communication, finance and weapons.If we pass the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism and if we take the steps that I have just listed out, it will help the international community, help all of us to isolate those countries that stand in support of terrorism.TIME: Prime Minister, you were mentioning about delinking terrorism from religion. You mentioned Taliban, you mentioned ISIS. The other two groups that are creating a lot of headlines worldwide with their activities are Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab in Africa. All of them claim to be doing what they are doing on behalf of Islam. Do you think that the Islamic world, Islam\u2019s world leaders should be doing more in their own communities to moderate those who are radicals, to do more on the education front and to cooperate more to fight these?Modi: When the initial question was asked there was reference to Taliban and ISIS. That is why when I framed my reply and I started my response, I basically prefaced it by saying that we have to look beyond individual groups. I did not respond specifically to the Taliban or to ISIS, but I responded to the need for the international community to look at this problem from a larger perspective and not from the individual perspectives of the nameplates or the groups that I referred to.I think terrorism is a thought process. It is a thought process that is a great threat to the international community. I am also not linking it to any particular religion or to the actions of religious leaders. I think it is something that, as I mentioned, the countries that believe in human values need to come together and fight as a collective and not looking at individual groups from the perspective of individual religions.TIME: If I could go back to two things that you said earlier, Prime Minister, you said that every country tries to increase its influence, sphere of influence. Sometimes that is obviously not very positive. One was what the US and India can both do together in the world. But one thing that the US is doing right now is trying to counter Russia\u2019s influence in Ukraine. Do you support international sanctions against Russia?Modi: This issue was raised in the G20 Summit. President Obama was present there, President Putin was present there, and I presented my viewpoint in the presence of both the Presidents. My view was that there are United Nations guidelines, there are provisions in the United Nations; and I think whatever is agreed within the framework of United Nations, the international community should follow it.TIME: Another big international issue that is coming up is the Paris Climate Summit later this year. Will India specify a peak for its emission, a cap on its emission?Modi: In the entire world, if you analyse very closely the cultural and the civilizational history of different countries, particularly looking at the lifestyle which they have followed over decades and centuries of their history, you will find that this part of the world, India in particular, has advocated and pursued economic growth in coexistence, in close bonding, with Nature for thousands of years of its history. In this part of the world, in Indian civilization in particular, the principle value is that exploitation of Nature is a crime, and we should only draw from Nature what is absolutely essential for your needs and not exploit it beyond that.If I may, in a somewhat lighter vein, recount a practice that is very common in the Indian cultural frame\u2026 it is that when you wake up in the morning and get off the bed, you step on to mother earth, causing it pain. What we teach our children is that earth is your mother that provides; she\u2019s a giver. So, please first ask forgiveness from the mother earth before you step on to it and cause it pain.We also teach in our cultural history that the entire universe is a family. For example, Indian bedtime stories \u2013 including school books \u2013 are quite replete with references to the Moon as maternal uncle and Sun as a grandfather. So when we view these aspects purely from the perspective of a family, our association with Nature is much deeper and of a very different kind.Insofar as the question specifically related to COP21 is concerned, I think if you look at the whole world, and the whole issue of climate change, if there is one part of the world which can provide natural leadership on this particular cause, it is this part of the world. Insofar as my specific role and responsibility is concerned, I am acutely conscious and aware of that. In fact, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, my government was probably the fourth State government in the world to establish a Climate Change Department within my particular State. And we closely linked its work to the growth policy that we adopted in the State.In future too, in terms of initiatives that we are going to take, there is going to be a heavy focus on using energy that is environment friendly. For example, we have launched a huge initiative in the field of renewable energy by setting a target for ourselves of 175 GW from renewable sources \u2013 100 GW from the solar sector and 75 GW from the wind sector. It is really an immense and huge initiative of my government.I have undertaken another mission mode project that we call Clean Ganga Mission. It is essentially on the re-invigoration of the river Ganges. River Ganges has a flow line of about 2,500 KM. Roughly 40 per cent of India\u2019s population is either directly or indirectly linked to this river. It is not merely a Clean Ganga Initiative, not just cleaning of a river; it is actually a huge developmental initiative whose primary focus is to undertake development that is environment friendly.In fact \u2013 and I say this to the entire international community \u2013 that those who believe in undertaking environment-friendly development in their own countries, I invite them to come and be partners in the cleaning of river Ganges which I think, as I said earlier, is essentially an environment-friendly growth and development model focussed on preservation of environment.I have undertaken these mission-mode environment preservation steps in several layers. One layer, for example, pertains to the saving of energy. We have made it a nation-wide campaign to distribute and to ensure popularity of LED bulbs \u2013 something which essentially reduces the carbon emission and carbon footprint of energy consumption nationally.For the farmers in India, I have launched an initiative called the Soil Health Card. It is essentially a system through which we inform the farmer of the toxicity in the soil which he is cultivating. The idea is to approach this entire issue in a scientific way and advise the farmer about his next steps in terms of reduced use of chemical fertilizers, in terms of increased use of organic fertilizers so that the fertility of the soil is preserved. Naturally, this reduces the environmental burden of agricultural cultivation within the country. For the Himalayan region of India, I want to convert it into the organic cultivation capital for the entire world.I will talk of another measure which may seem like a small measure but which has a great environmental impact within the country. In India we provide to the households subsidized LPG gas cylinders for cooking. Sometime ago, I requested the rich and the wealthy to give up their gas cylinder subsidy to free up the usage of the cooking gas cylinders. Within a short period of time, about 400,000 families gave up their subsidized gas cylinders. My objective is to pass on the freed-up gas cylinders to the poor families which will help us achieve three objectives. Firstly, they would stop using the forest wood for cooking purposes which will prevent the degradation of the forests. Second, it will reduce carbon emissions because burning of the forest wood has a higher carbon footprint. Third, it will also reduce the health problems which are caused in poor families when they burn forest wood for cooking. So, essentially we try to achieve all the three objectives \u2013 reduce carbon footprint, reduce forest degradation, yet improve the health of the poor families through this very simple environment friendly measure.Another decision that we have recently announced clubs together two concepts \u2013 providing rural employment and increasing the green cover in rural areas; we have provided a quantum of Rs. 40,000 crore (approx. $ 6.7 billion) to afforest the rural land, provide employment in rural areas, leading to conservation of environment.Another measure we have taken is to build Metro mass transportation facilities in 50 cities of India. Similarly, in 500 cities of India, we have started elaborate waste water treatment and solid waste management plans. The idea is to build these facilities through public private partnerships by using global competitive aspects. All these measures which I have described have been taken in the last 10 months with the principle objective of ensuring that our economic growth is environment friendly.The second aspect that I keep pointing out but perhaps international community is still not ready to focus on it or does not focus on it yet, is the need to change our lifestyles. I think the throw-away culture, the culture of disposables, causes a huge burden on the environment. I think recycling, or the re-usage of the resources of the earth, is an important aspect which should be ingrained in our daily lifestyle. I think it is important to change our lifestyles.TIME: Prime Minister, you have talked about the economic and development reforms that you have been introducing in India, but there are other benchmarks of progress. President Obama said earlier this year that for India to succeed, it is critical that the nation does not splinter along religious lines. What would you make from President Obama\u2019s remarks?Modi: India is a civilization with a history that is thousands of years old. If you analyze the history of India carefully, you will probably not come across a single incident where India has attacked another country. Similarly you will not find any references in our history where we have waged war based on ethnicity or religion. The diversity of India, of our civilization, is actually a thing of beauty, which is something we are extremely proud of. Our philosophy of life, something that we have lived for thousands of years, is also reflected in our constitution. Our constitution has not come out of any abstract insularity. It essentially reflects our own civilizational ethos of equal respect for all religions. As Indian scriptures say, \u201cTruth is one but sages call it by different names\u201d. Similarly, Swami Vivekananda, when he travelled to Chicago for the World Congress of Religions, had said that respecting religions is not simply a question of universal tolerance; it is a question of believing that all religions are true. So it is a positive approach and aspect that India and Indian civilization take towards religion. If you look at one of the micro minorities of the world, the Parsi community, it has probably flourished the maximum in India. One of our Chiefs of Army Staff has been from the Parsi community. One of our biggest industrialists is from the Parsi community. A Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was from this micro minority community. So for us, the acceptance of all religions is in our blood, it is there in our civilization. It is ingrained in our system to work together, taking all the religions along with us.My philosophy, the philosophy of my party and the philosophy also of my government is, what I call \u2018Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas\u2019, which essentially means, \u201cTogether with all, progress for all\u201d. So, the underlying philosophy and the impulse of that particular motto is to take everybody together and move towards inclusive growth.TIME: As we are heading to the US political campaign, a lot of America\u2019s political leaders are talking about the role that their faith plays and their views of themselves as leaders. Could you talk a little about what your faith of Hinduism means to you as India\u2019s leader?Modi: Religion and faith are very personal matters. So far as the government is concerned, there is only one holy book, which is the Constitution of India.In fact, if I look at the definition of Hinduism, the Supreme Court of India has given a beautiful definition; it says that Hinduism is not a religion, it is actually a way of life.If one looks at my own belief, I think I have grown up with these values which I mentioned earlier, that religion is a way of life. We also say \u2018Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam\u2019 \u2013 the entire world is one family, and respect for all religions. Those are the values I have grown up with.Essentially the crux of Indian philosophy, the Hindu philosophy, is that all should be happy, all should be healthy, all should live life to the fullest. It is not something that is specific to a particular religion, or to a particular sect. It\u2019s a philosophy, it\u2019s a way of life which encompasses all societies.And Hinduism is a religion with immense depth and vast diversity. For example, the one who does idol worship is a Hindu and one who hates idol worship can also be a Hindu.TIME: Mr. Prime minister, some members of your party have said some unkind things about minority religions in India and we do understand that Muslim, Christians, some others have worried about the future of their practicing their faith in India and we are trying to understand that you are saying that under your leadership, they should not be worried?Modi: In so far the Bhartiya Janata Party and my government are concerned, we absolutely do not believe in this type of ideology. And wherever an individual view might have been expressed with regard to a particular minority religion, we have immediately negated that. So far as BJP and my government are concerned, as I mentioned earlier, there is only one holy book of reference, which is the Constitution of India. For us, the unity and the integrity of the country are the top most priorities. All religions and all communities have the same rights and it is my responsibility to ensure their complete and total protection. My Government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed, and religion. So there is no place for imaginary apprehensions with regard to the rights of the minorities in India.TIME: Prime Minister, if I could go back to your election last year. A key thing and the most important was the economy that was spoken about. But here on, a lot of investors have begun to ask questions about the pace of reform, is it fast enough? That the economy basically benefitted from falling oil prices\u2026 What you make of those questions about the pace at which you have reformed and what reforms you are planning as you are going to your second year?Modi: If you were to pick up the news papers for the period March-May 2014 last year and read them, you will actually get the context and key aspects of the context in which we were approaching the elections at that time. One of which was that nothing seemed to be happening in the Government. There seemed to be a complete policy paralysis at that time. Two, corruption had spread throughout the system. Three, there was no leadership; it was a weak government at the centre. That was the context and the background in which I was elected. My election, my government\u2019s coming into power last year in 2014, should be viewed in the context of the developments over the last ten years in the country before May 2014. So you need to see ten years of the last government versus ten months of my government.You will actually see that, internationally, the whole world is, once again, excited and enthusiastic about India and the opportunities that India represents. Another way to look at it is that, at the start of the 21st century, the term BRIC was coined to represent the four major emerging economies. The assessment was that the BRIC countries will drive international economic growth. Six-seven years before 2014, a view started emerging that \u2018I\u2019 in the BRIC had perhaps become less relevant or perhaps even a drag on the BRIC grouping.In the last 10 months, the \u2018I\u2019 has reclaimed its position in the BRICS. Internationally, whether it is the IMF, the World Bank, Moody\u2019s or other credit agencies, they are all saying in one voice, that India has a great economic future. It is progressing at a fast pace and has again become a factor of growth and stability in the international economic system. India is now one of the fastest growing economies in the world.The last ten months clearly prove that so far as the expectations of the people are concerned, both in the country and internationally, we are moving very rapidly to fulfil those expectations.I have in my mind a very clear outline of the framework of what we are going to do in the next five years. What we have done in the last one year is precisely as per that plan. And in the next four years, we have step-by-step measures that would unfold as we go along. So far as the reform process in the last eleven months is concerned, it is not simply a question of policy reforms that my government has taken. We have also undertaken focused administrative reforms. To establish (i) ease of doing business; (ii) making government more accountable; (iii) reforms at the level of technology and governance; (iv) reforms at all layers of the government, whether it\u2019s local government or state government or central government. We have essentially taken the reform process to an entirely different level where both the Federal and the state level respond through a policy-based and administrative reform system.The biggest reform since India\u2019s independence in the field of taxation that is coming up is the GST and it is our expectation that we would start implementing it from the 2016 fiscal year.Another example is increasing the Foreign Direct Investment cap in the field of insurance to 49%. This was stuck for the last 7 \u2013 8 years and was not making any progress. We ensured that it was passed by the parliament within the first year of our government.TIME: Prime Minister, when some people compare China and India\u2019s economic development, there are some people who say that China has been much faster and much more successful because it is a one-party state in which the leader of the party can basically dictate his and his Cabinet\u2019s policies. India of course is a democracy. You have a mandate in the Lower House of Parliament. You do not have a majority in the Upper House. Things like for example your new Land Acquisitions Law can run into obstacles because of the system that India has. Do you sometimes think that you would love to have President Xi\u2019s power to push things through?Modi: India by its very nature is a democracy. It is not just as per our Constitution that we are a democratic country; it is in our DNA. In so far as different political parties of India are concerned, I firmly believe that they have the maturity and wisdom to make decisions that are in the best interests of the nation. I firmly believe that for us, democracy and belief in democratic values, are a matter of faith, which are spread across all political parties in the country. It is true that we do not have a majority in the Upper House. Despite that, if you look at the productivity of the Parliament, it has actually been quite an achievement under our government. In Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the Parliament, productivity has been about 124% whereas productivity in the Upper House has been about 107%. Overall, it conveys a very positive message of legislative action. In all, about 40 bills have been passed in the Parliament. So if you were to ask me whether you need dictatorship to run India, no, you do not. Whether you need a dictatorial thought to run the country, no, you do not. Whether you need a powerful person who believes in concentrating power at one place, no you do not. If anything is required to take India forward, it is an innate belief in democracy and democratic values. I think that is what is needed and that is what we have. If you were to ask me at a personal level to choose between democratic values on the one hand, and wealth, power, prosperity and fame on the other hand, I will very easily and without any doubt choose democracy and belief in democratic values.TIME: One of the aspects, one of the pillars of a democracy is freedom of speech. Earlier this year, the authorities in India banned a documentary about the terrible rape case that took place in December of 2012. Why did the authorities do that and what are to you the limits of free speech? Do you think free speech should have some limits?Modi: There are two different things which are dealt in this question and I will try to address them both. But, first in a somewhat lighter vein, if I could just recount a well-known episode about Galileo. He had propounded the principles of revolution of the earth around the sun but in the societal paradigm at that particular time, those principles were against what was enshrined in the Bible and a decision was taken to imprison Galileo at that time.Now India is a civilization where the principle and philosophy of sacrifice is ingrained as part of our upbringing. If you take that as a background and look at our history, there used to be another great thinker of the time called Charvaka who propounded a theory of extreme hedonism which was contradictory to the Indian ethos. He essentially said that \u201cYou do not have to worry about tomorrow, just live, eat, make merry today\u201d. But even he with those extreme thoughts, which were totally contradictory to the Indian ethos, was equated to a sage and accommodated and given space to express his views in the Indian society.So in so far as freedom of speech is concerned, there is absolutely not an iota of doubt in terms of our commitment and our belief in that.If you look at the issue related to the telecast of the documentary that you referred, it is not a question of freedom of speech, it is more a legal question. It has two or three aspects. One aspect is that the identity of the rape victim should not be revealed which would have happened if this interview was allowed to be telecast. Two, the case is still sub judice and the telecast which features the interview of the person who is alleged to have committed the crime could have impacted the judicial process. Three, it is also our responsibility to ensure protection of the victim. If we had allowed such a thing to happen, in effect, we would have violated the dignity of the victim. So I do not think it is a question of freedom of speech, it is more a question of law and respecting the victim and the judicial processes in this particular case. In so far as freedom of speech is concerned, as I mentioned earlier, there is absolutely no issue. It is something that we greatly respect as an important aspect of our democratic values.TIME: I wonder if I might ask one last question before we turn you over to Peter, who is very eager. We talk a lot about influence and in the Time 100, these are people who we think right now are exerting an enormous influence on the world stage, can you tell us who has influenced you the most?Modi: The question that you have asked actually touches my deepest core. I was born in a very poor family. I used to sell tea in a railway coach as a child. My mother used to wash utensils and do lowly household work in the houses of others to earn a livelihood.I have seen poverty very closely. I have lived in poverty. As a child, my entire childhood was steeped in poverty. For me, poverty, in a way, was the first inspiration of my life, a commitment to do something for the poor. I decided that I would not live for myself but would live for others and work for them. My experience of growing up in poverty deeply impacted my childhood. Then, at the age of 12 or 13, I started reading the works of Swami Vivekananda. That gave me courage and a vision, it sharpened and deepened my sensitivities and gave me a new perspective and a direction in life. At the age of 15 or 16, I decided to dedicate myself to others and till date I am continuing to follow that decision.",

Although the rain has tapered off in some areas, floodwaters are still climbing up over scores of river banks. Traffic in the French capital was snarled as flooding choked roads, and several Paris railway stations were shut.While the Louvre's most famous painting, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" was safe on an upper floor, officials said about 250,000 artworks were located in flood-risk areas, mostly in basement storerooms. The art was hastily being moved upstairs -- a move officials described as precautionary.The Orsay museum, on the left bank of the Seine, was also closed Friday to prepare for possible flooding.A spokeswoman at the Louvre said museum had not taken such precautions in its modern history - since its 1993 renovation at the very least. She spoke on condition of anonymity in line with the museum's policy.At the Louvre, disappointed tourists were being turned away.\"I am really sorry, but we're closed today,\" one staffer told visitors. \"We have to evacuate masterpieces from the basement.\"Elsewhere in Europe, authorities were counting the cost of the floods as they waded through muddy streets and waterlogged homes.German authorities said the body of a 65-year-old man was found overnight in the town of Simbach am Inn, bringing the country's death toll to 10. France's Interior Ministry also reported the death of a 74-year-old man who fell from his horse and drowned in a river in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris, the second death in France.In eastern Romania, two people died and 200 people were evacuated from their homes as floods swept the area, including one man who was ripped from his bicycle by a torrent of water in the eastern village of Ruginesti.Several other people in Europe were missing Friday, including a Belgian beekeeper who was swept away by the current while trying to save his hives from rising waters in the eastern village of Harsin.The foul weather has compounded the travel disruptions in France, which is already dealing with the fallout from weeks of strikes and other industrial actions by workers upset over the government's proposed labor reforms. French rail company SNCF said the strikes had led to the cancellation of some 40 percent of the country's high-speed trains.In addition, French energy company Enedis says that more than 20,000 customers are without power to the east and south of Paris.Outside the Louvre, tourists expressed understanding over the museum's closure.\"It's good that they are evacuating the paintings. It's a shame that we couldn't see them today, but it's right that they do these things,\" said Carlos Santiago, who was visiting from Mexico.",

Here is what\u2019s at stake for the Republicans and the Democrats:It has been said before, but this time it may really be true \u2014 this is the last chance for Donald Trump\u2019s foes to stop him from winning the nomination. Trump currently has 996 delegates. He needs a total of 1,237 to win the Republican nomination on the first ballot at the party\u2019s convention in July \u2014 which would likely be his only chance at the nod, as it is thought that in an open convention Ted Cruz, John Kasich, or perhaps even another candidate like Mitt Romney would be nominated.Cruz has no path to the nomination on the first ballot, but he could theoretically stop Trump from getting to 1,237 delegates. But several remaining states \u2014 including California and New Jersey \u2014 are likely to break for Trump. So if Cruz doesn\u2019t take the majority of the delegates in Indiana on Tuesday evening, his plan to Trump may die. The polls currently don\u2019t look good for Cruz, with Trump ahead in Indiana by an average of 10 points.Hillary Clinton has stemmed Bernie Sanders\u2019 rising tide, posting a big win in New York last month and winning another handful of primaries a week later. Still, Sanders is vowing to stay in the race until the party\u2019s convention and fight for superdelegates along the way. If Sanders wins in Indiana, his plan may gain some degree of legitimacy. Sanders is currently trailing in the polls, but by just around 6%. The Vermont senator has outperformed his polling in the region before, so it is possible he\u2019ll do better than expected.",

The two also occasionally use Twitter to support each other.Clinton notably retweeted Sanders when he said \"America's first black president cannot and will not be succeeded by a hatemonger who refuses to condemn the KKK.\"And Sanders retweeted Clinton when she sent out a link to donate to Flint.More from AOL.com: Marco Rubio wins Washington DC caucus, NBC News projects 'Ruin the rest of their lives': Donald Trump calls for arrests after wave of protests at rally Carson says Trump 'didn't really believe' his own rhetoric",

        "text": "Choosing which 1040 tax form you need to file your return on can be a lot harder to figure out than you'd think, but answering just a few basic questions will lead you to the right version.First of all, if you use tax software to prepare your return, then it will generally take the decision of which tax form to file out of your hands. Instead, the software will evaluate the answers you provide to its list of questions and then select the most appropriate form for your needs.For those who prepare their own returns, though, the basic Internal Revenue Service rule is that the best form to file is the simplest one that addresses all of your needs. The 1040EZ is the easiest form to fill out, with the 1040A being more complicated but still less difficult than the full 1040 form.Form 1040EZ is designed for the simplest returns. In order to use it, you have to meet several requirements.First of all, Form 1040EZ is only available for filing status of single or married filing jointly, and those who have dependents to claim can't use the form. Taxpayers have to be under age 65 and ineligible for higher standard deductions for the blind.In addition, there are income-related restrictions. You can't have more than $100,000 in taxable income, and in general, it can only come from wages, salaries, tips, unemployment compensation and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Some taxable interest is allowed, but only if it's less than $1,500 for the year. Alaska residents are also allowed to use 1040EZ even if they receive Permanent Fund dividends from the state.Finally, the only credit you can claim on the 1040EZ is the Earned Income Credit, and you can't itemize deductions or make any other adjustments to income. Those who received advance payments of premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act aren't eligible to file Form 1040EZ. Those who hire household employees like babysitters or nannies for whom they have to pay employment taxes also can't file 1040EZ, as well as those who are debtors in bankruptcy filings after Oct. 16, 2005.Form 1040A has some of the same restrictions as 1040EZ. Income has to be less than $100,000, and you still can't itemize deductions. But it's more flexible in other areas. For instance, heads of household, qualifying widows and widowers, and married people filing separately can use Form 1040A.Form 1040A allows you to include more types of income. In addition to those allowed on 1040EZ, you can have ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions from mutual funds, pension and annuity income, IRA distributions, and taxable Social Security benefits and still file a 1040A. You can also claim deductions for IRA contributions, student loan interest, tuition and fee payments, and expenses that educators pay for supplies for their own classrooms.You can also claim more credits on a 1040A. Those seeking credits for child and dependent care expenses, education expenses, and retirement savings contributions can use the form, as can those claiming credits for the elderly or disabled. Both the child tax credit and the additional child tax credit are available to 1040A filers.Lastly, you can handle a limited number of special situations on 1040A. Those receiving dependent care benefits from work can use the form, as can those who have to pay taxes due to having past educational credits recaptured. Even some people who owe alternative minimum taxes can use Form 1040A.If you don't qualify for 1040EZ or 1040A treatment, then your only choice is the long Form 1040. Most notably, that includes taxpayers who want to itemize deductions.For those who want it, the IRS has developed a tool to help you figure out which form is the simplest available for your needs. You can access it at, and it will take information from the tax forms you've received from your employer, financial institutions, and other sources to make a recommendation.Filing your taxes can seem complicated. But by starting with the right form, you'll be able to keep things as simple as possible and avoid biting off more than you need to chew at tax time.",
        "summary": "Make sure you choose the federal tax form that best reflects your income, credits, deductions and breaks: 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ."

She said he runs a one-man real estate operation out of his Fairfield home, which is two doors from the second home that Daly and his wife purchased.According to Cisneros, the Dalys bought their first home from a young couple who have one child and had another on the way. They got behind in their mortgage payments after the husband lost his job as a roofer and the bank refused to renegotiate their loan, Cisneros said.Rather than let the house fall into foreclosure, the couple did a \"short sale,\" in which the bank allows the house to go for less than the outstanding debt. Cisneros said the Dalys' offer was actually the lowest of three bids on the house, but the only one that was an all-cash deal. The Dalys ended up renting the house to someone else.Daly declined to speak to us, but told The Chronicle's Marisa Lagos that his parents took out a line of equity to pay for each home, and that he plans to pay them back - in part, by refinancing the properties and his condo in San Francisco, leaving him with a mortgage on all three.Revolving door: More changes in San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's political galaxy.Top political fundraiser Paige Barry Arata, who worked on both of Newsom's mayoral campaigns and served as his confidential secretary at City Hall during his first term, is bowing out as the finance director for his gubernatorial bid and returning to her old job at City Hall.Barry Arata's departure comes as the campaign is coming under increasing pressure to bring in more money to stay competitive with Newsom's presumed rival in next year's Democratic gubernatorial primary, Attorney General Jerry Brown. She says it was always her plan to move back to city government.Word of Barry Arata's return to her $80,000-a-year job comes on the heels of the resignation of longtime Newsom adviser Eric Jaye, who parted with Newsom over differences in campaign strategy.Meanwhile, back at City Hall, two key players are leaving. WadeCrowfoot, the man Newsom tagged as his $136,000-a-year global greening guru, decided to take a hike Friday. And Nani Coloretti, the mayor's budget director, accepted a job as deputy assistant to the U.S. Treasury secretary.The mayor brought in Crowfoot to come up with environmental issues that would get Newsom as much press as possible. That's how bottled water got banned from City Hall and how the city got \"Sunday Streets,\" during which main arteries are closed so people can frolic.Now, Crowfoot is taking a job with the Environmental Defense Fund.\"It's a good opportunity for me to spread my wings,\" he said. He'll be replaced by Johanna Partin.BART bill: Talk ain't cheap, especially when it comes to BART labor negotiations - which are now in their 119th day.Since talks began between the transit system and five unions representing 2,800 workers, the agency has spent:-- $1.26 million for 44 union representatives who have taken time off from their regular jobs for the talks.-- $500,000 for the law firm Burke, Williams and Sorensen, which is serving as BART's chief negotiators.-- $45,000 for Singer and Associations, the public relations firm handling BART's strategy and spin.-- And $150,000 to rent two floors of a downtown Oakland office building where the talks are being held.Total cost so far: $1.95 million and counting.Match? San Francisco arson investigators have noticed some similarities between the recent spate of car torchings around town and the portable-toilet fires from a couple of months back.In both cases, the attacks appear to be random - and in both cases, the fires have been started with newspaper stuffed under the targets.EXTRA!

        "text": "Taking Cuba off the list of nations that sponsor terrorism is the latest development that will attract foreign companies to the island. So who wants in? These five stats explain which industries present the most opportunities as Cuba opens for business.One of the immediate benefits of renewed relations with Cuba is the increase in permitted remittance flows. The most recent figures put annual cash remittances to Cuba at approximately $5.1 billion, a level greater than the four fastest growing sectors of the Cuban economy combined. Now, permitted remittance levels from the U.S. will be raised fourfold, from $2,000 to $8,000 per year. This will help drive an increase in spending power in Cuba, which is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 4.6% through this decade. For global companies seeking a foothold anywhere they can, more money in the pockets of Cubans means more fuel for expansion. Take Coca-Cola. With an open Cuba, Coke could be legally be sold in every country in the world save one: North Korea.(Fortune, The White House, Euromonitor, Wall Street Journal)2. A lot more visitorsJust 110 miles off the coast of Florida, Cuba should be a natural magnet for American travelers. Despite needing to meet special criteria to receive a visa from the State Department\u2014allowable categories include educational and journalistic activities\u2014170,000 Americans visited the country last year. As the restrictions slacken, the sky is literally the limit. JetBlue already charters flights to Cuba from the U.S., but the budget airline wants to start running regular commercial flights. American Airlines Group now flies to Cuba 20 times per week, a 33% increase in flights compared to just a year ago. More flights\u2014and more competition\u2014will make airfare more affordable, driving additional tourist traffic.(Travel Pulse, CNN Money, Wall Street Journal)Only one in ten Cubans regularly use mobile phones and only one in twenty have uncensored access to the Internet. Even state-restricted Internet penetration currently stands at just 23.2%. The telecom infrastructure is so underdeveloped that an hour of regulated Internet connectivity can cost up to 20% of the average Cuban\u2019s monthly salary. There\u2019s serious demand for the major infrastructure investments needed to improve these numbers. Some start-ups are making waves in spite of shoddy internet. Airbnb, a website that lets people rent out lodging, announced that it has started booking rooms in Cuba with over 1,000 hosts. It gets around the lack of Internet by teaming with middlemen who have long worked to link tourists with bed and breakfasts.(Wharton, Freedom House, Fast Company)4. A cure for CubaCuba has the third highest number of physicians per capita, behind only Monaco and Qatar. They\u2019re even used as an export: Venezuela pays $5.5 billion a year for the almost 40,000 Cuban medical professionals who now make up half of its health-care personnel. Cuban doctors lack access to most American pharmaceutical products and, importantly, to third-generation antibiotics. For its part, Cuba\u2019s surprisingly robust biotech industry makes a number of vaccines not currently available in the U.S. With the normalization of relations, Cuba can look to fully capitalize on its medical strengths.(Bloomberg, World Health Organization, Modern Healthcare, Brookings)Cuba currently attracts around $500 million in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u2014good for just 1% of GDP. Given its tumultuous political history and underdeveloped economy, it is difficult to accurately predict how quickly investors will flock once the embargo has been lifted. But a good comparison might be the Dominican Republic, another Caribbean nation with roughly the same size population as Cuba. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that Cuba could potentially attract as much foreign capital as the Dominican Republic, which currently receives $17 billion in FDI ($2 billion from the U.S). But this won\u2019t happen overnight\u2014in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom, Cuba ranks 177th out of 178, ahead only of North Korea.(Wharton, ASCE, Peterson Institute, Heritage Foundation)",

        "text": "Corinne Grousbeck remembers the first time people treated her son Campbell as someone to be feared.Campbell, now 23, was about 18 months old. He\u2019d been born with serious visual impairment, and he wore glasses on the chance that his vision might improve, although it never did. \u201cBig goofy glasses,\u201d Grousbeck recalls.One day, Grousbeck took him to the market. She had Campbell in a shopping cart when a little girl approached. The girl was curious about his eyewear, and started to engage with the tot.\u201cHe was not talking yet, but he got all animated,\u201d Grousbeck says. \u201cThen her mother came and scooped the little girl up. She said \u2018Honey, leave that little boy alone. There\u2019s something wrong with him.\u2019 \u201dNow Grousbeck is out to wake up the public about society\u2019s misperceptions about the blind. Grousbeck, who chairs the board of trustees of Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, has spearheaded BlindNewWorld, a social change campaign aimed at breaking down the social and emotional barriers between the blind and the sighted. Grousbeck rattles off the list: \u201cFear, stigma, discomfort, pity.\u201dBlindNewWorld includes a social media effort and an inviting website that features stories, tips, and a quiz to educate sighted people about stereotypes and how to behave around the blind. Grousbeck also oversaw the production of two engaging public service announcements by Hollywood film and commercial director Tom DeCerchio.In one of them, a single woman spots an attractive man across the room. When her friend tells her the man is blind, she has a moment\u2019s pause. Then she says, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I just came from yoga, and I\u2019m not wearing any makeup.\u201d In the other, an Uber driver discovers his blind passenger is a corporate vice president, and he learns just how capable the blind can be.\u201cIn the time since Campbell was little, the Internet has exploded, and with that came adaptive technology, and that has really balanced the skill set,\u201d says Grousbeck who was recently divorced from Wycliffe \u201cWyc\u201d Grousbeck, co-owner of the Celtics. She and Campbell are sitting in the living room of the Chestnut Hill home they moved into at the beginning of the year. It\u2019s still in transition \u2014 painting just finished, carpet still rolled up. Campbell navigates with his cane.It\u2019s been a busy year for the Grousbecks. Corinne launched BlindNewWorld as she handled her duties at Perkins and as an overseer at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. She also serves on the leadership council for the chief of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, and is on the boards of several other organizations.This month, her daughter Kelsey, Campbell\u2019s older sister, earned her MBA from Boston University, and Campbell graduated from Lesley University\u2019s two-year Threshold Program for young adults with special needs. He works as an assistant teacher at a preschool.\u201cI read them books, play my ukulele, and sing with them,\u201d Campbell says.\u201cIn the time since Campbell was little,\u201d says Corinne Grousbeck (above with her son on the Perkins School campus), \u201cthe Internet has exploded, and with that came adaptive technology, and that has really balanced the skill set.\u201dThe Americans With Disabilities Act mandates a job coach, who alerts Campbell if children run astray, but Campbell does the teaching.Campbell, an upbeat young man, has his own ways of smoothing the social waters. \u201cWhen a waitress has a nice voice, I ask her name,\u201d he says \u201cShe may say, \u2018Jane.\u2019 I\u2019ll say, oh, I know that name, it\u2019s a nice name.\u201d A connection is made.The BlindNewWorld campaign is sponsored by Perkins, where Campbell is an alumnus. It follows on the heels of a Perkins study about how sighted people view the blind. Large percentages of those surveyed are wary of them.\u201cThe unemployment rate for the blind is two times the national average for the sighted,\u201d says Dave Power, Perkins\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cCorinne put her finger on a broader issue. Even if hired, there\u2019s a whole issue of comfort level with the blind. All the stats in this study bear out that barriers to success have to do with other people\u2019s perceptions.\u201dIn 2014, Perkins started the Perkins-Business Partnership, bringing local businesses together to brainstorm about hiring. There, Grousbeck found forward-thinking companies such as State Street Bank, which she says values the benefits of hiring people with disabilities.\u201cIf you have a blizzard, half the employees don\u2019t show up,\u201d Grousbeck says. \u201cThe blind do. They work hard. They take public transportation. They take pride in their work. They\u2019re tenacious.\u201dThe BlindNewWorld website spotlights several successful visually impaired people, such as Karen Nagle and her husband, Chris. They live in Salem with their sons Eli and Henry, both younger than 3. Karen and Chris are legally blind. Chris is a software engineer, and Karen is a teacher who works with blind students in Salem public schools.\u201cA lot of people are afraid of blindness in general. Society is so visual,\u201d Karen said in an interview. \u201cPeople can\u2019t comprehend how the heck blind people do stuff, and they hold on to the stereotype of helplessness.\u201dKaren gets around with a seeing-eye dog. Once, as she was headed down the stairs at an MBTA Red Line station, \u201ca woman comes behind me and pulls my backpack to tell me there\u2019s an elevator,\u201d she says. \u201cShe got an earful from me. I could have fallen, and so could she.\u201dThen there was the time standing in line with her kids at the local market. \u201cThe guy in front of me tosses dollars at me,\u201d Karen says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say hi to me, he didn\u2019t talk to me. I gave it to the cashier to keep in case anyone was short a dollar or two.\u201dWhen Grousbeck first invited a copywriter to develop scripts for the PSAs, \u201cThe words came from pity,\u201d she says. Then she tapped DeCerchio, who asked her to fly to Los Angeles so he could read his scripts to her face-to-face. What she saw was the antidote to pity.\u201cI got goosebumps,\u201d she says. \u201c It\u2019s the dignity.\u201dRoughly 7 million Americans are blind. A recent Perkins School for the Blind study surveyed 1,000 people of all ages around the country. Among the findings:\u25a0 80 percent feel sorry for the blind.\u25a0 53 percent say they are uncomfortable around blind people.\u25a0 82 percent think the blind can\u2019t play sports.\u25a0 81 percent think the blind can\u2019t babysit.\u25a0 70 percent believe people who can\u2019t see can\u2019t shop for clothes.\u25a0 46 percent say they cannot think of a worse condition than blindness \u2014 including terminal illness and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u25a0 Only 28 percent think a person who is blind could do the respondent\u2019s job.It\u2019s not hard to make the world more hospitable to those who can\u2019t see. Here are some of BlindNewWorld\u2019s tips on how to be more inclusive:\u25a0 Introduce yourself in a normal tone of voice. (No need to speak louder than usual.)\u25a0 Discourage young children and others from staring or making disparaging comments.\u25a0 Offer to help blind people across construction zones and dangerous intersections.\u25a0 In a social situation, offer assistance: describe the layout of the room and who is there.\u25a0 Begin work meetings by asking people to identify themselves. Provide materials electronically instead of or in addition to hard copies.\u25a0 Don\u2019t fret about using vision-oriented phrases such as \u201cdid you see that?\u201d\u25a0 Don\u2019t pet the guide dog.",

        "text": "GANDER, Newfoundland \u2014 It could have been a short, sweet story: planes get diverted, local people pitch in to help stranded passengers. Polite thank-you letters and gifts follow.What happened in Newfoundland in one terrifying week in September was all that. But in the next two months, the story continued to grow. Here and in scattered hamlets for miles around, everyone has a part of it to tell \u2014 how half a dozen or so isolated communities have been embraced by strangers who dropped from the sky and changed their lives.Greg King was there when it started. An air traffic controller, he was on duty on Sept. 11 at Gander, once the hub of North Atlantic air travel, but now an airport that sees few commercial aircraft on the ground while still directing them overhead. Late that morning, when he was preparing for the daily \"wall of airplanes\" from Europe heading for arrivals in New York and other cities, Mr. King suddenly received an order to shut down the sky.Thirty-eight planes were told to land immediately, and for a couple of hours Mr. King barely had time to call his wife and say he would be bringing strangers home for the night. At some point, he recalls, he also registered a fleeting image of an Air France Boeing 747 \"bigger than the airport terminal.\"Gander, a town of 10,000 people with 550 hotel rooms, had to find beds and food for 6,579 passengers and crew members. Other airstrip towns in Newfoundland and Labrador also had unexpected company, but not on this scale.\"This never happened before in the history of aviation,\" said Terry Parsons, chairman of the Gander International Airport Authority. Fortunately, Gander \u2014 created as a military airfield and a trans-Atlantic refueling point in the 1930's \u2014 has a long runway, and a disaster plan. It also has churches, service clubs, doctors and shop owners with small- town, good-neighbor values long out of date in many places, including other parts of Canada.\"We're used to helping people,\" said Mayor Claude Elliott, speaking of a region that lives with rough seas, harsh weather and an uncertain economy. \"I guess our biggest problem was trying to explain to people where they were.\"Jake Turner, the town manager, went into action as soon as the planes started landing. Des Dillon of the Canadian Red Cross was asked to round up beds, along with Maj. Ron Stuckless of the Salvation Army, who also became the coordinator of a mass collection of food that emptied refrigerators for miles around. Employees from the local co-op supermarket arrived with a refrigerated truck full of meat and other provisions. At St. Martin's Anglican Church, Hilda Goodyear spent 48 mostly sleepless hours organizing bedding and priming the parish hall's kitchen for a Lufthansa flight.People from as far away as Twillingate, an island off the Kittiwake Coast of Newfoundland, prepared enough sandwiches and soup for at least 200 people and drove an hour and a half to Gander to deliver it to dazed and frightened passengers being herded off planes without luggage and under intense scrutiny.Responding to radio announcements, the residents and businesses of Gander and other towns supplied toothbrushes, deodorant, soap, blankets and even spare underwear, along with offers of hot showers and guest rooms. Newtel Communications, the telephone company, set up phone banks for passengers to call home. Local television cable companies wired schools and church halls, where passengers watched events unfolding in New York and realized how lucky they were.There were some with special needs. Carl and Ethna Smith found kosher food through an airport caterer and a new set of kitchenware for an orthodox Jewish family from New York. At the Gander Baptist Church, Gary and Donna House dealt with the needs of four Moldovan refugee families, members of a religious sect who spoke no English and were bewildered by events.The passengers, who left with tears and hugs, have responded with their own astonishing acts of generosity. Lewisporte, a seaside town where 4,000 people made room for 773 unexpected guests, received new lighting for the Anglican church and a scholarship fund worth $19,000 \"and still growing\" said the mayor, Bill Hooper.More than $51,000 has been donated so far to Gander, a town where no one asked to be paid for their hospitality.Those five days in September, and the stream of e-mail messages, gifts, photographs and invitations that still pour in, have given an incalculable lift to the Newfoundlanders \u2014 the \"Newfies\" who are the butt of rube jokes in the rest of Canada.\"It gave the people a sense of self- worth,\" said Mr. House, a retired teacher and school librarian. \"Newfoundlanders have often felt put down. They speak funny. There are all those `goofy Newfie' jokes.\"Hey! We are all appreciated,\" he added. \"We are good people.\"",

And I\u2019m hardly alone. In short, we seem to have reached peak unicorn.In response, many have shrugged and said something like, \u201cEven if all of these companies were to completely fail, it wouldn\u2019t really have a broad economic impact. The amount of venture capital invested each year is tiny compared to the public markets, and just half of the amount of VC invested in the dot-com boom.\u201dTo be clear, I\u2019m not predicting that all of these companies will fail, or anything close to it. Instead, I think the next step will be a series of so-called \u201cdown rounds,\u201d or at least structured debt financings that don\u2019t officially affect equity values. Plus a bit more M&A activity.But it\u2019s also not appropriate to brush off potential unicorn struggles as something that would only affect a small group of wealthy investors.When valuations begin to contract, so can company growth, particularly when it comes to hiring. Growth\u2014even in something as seemingly random as valuations\u2014begets growth. If capital availability tightens, it can lead to layoffs.In response to a request from Fortune, research firm PitchBook reports that 91 U.S.-based unicorn companies employ around 57,000 people. And that\u2019s a low estimate, given that PitchBook doesn\u2019t have data on some companies and has dated figures for others.Just look at the employee count jumps for a few unicorns between August 2014 and August and/or September 2015:The downside of the valuation peak is almost certain to result in fewer jobs, which has all sorts of negative economic consequences (less spending, etc.).Now, I\u2019m not saying you should be shedding tears for tech workers, and I\u2019m sure that some San Francisco housing advocates would celebrate widespread tech layoffs. Instead, it\u2019s simply a reminder to all of us that these much-derided, made-up valuations of \u201cunicorns\u201d have tangible effects on real people.

But it can be helpful to understand the underlying poetic truth.Here are four ways the two Exodus stories diverge.1. The Bible: Exodus is a story of ethical and political redemption.The Film: Hebrew slaves are freed, but racial controversy surrounding the film clouded the story\u2019s overall message of liberation. Scott selected white characters as Egyptians and Hebrews in the film. The only visible black characters are other slaves in Pharaoh\u2019s palace who do not appear to be liberated with the Hebrew people.2. The Bible: God is depicted as a king and man of war, who takes on Pharaoh, the God and King of the Egyptians.The Film: The God-character is depicted as a child, played by eleven-year-old Isaac Andrews. It is unclear whether he represents God or a figment of Moses\u2019 imagination or an angel or something else. Moses is not sent to Pharaoh by God, but goes on his own. The drama in the film is inter-human, between Moses and Pharaoh than between God and Pharaoh.3. The Bible: Moses flees Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave.The Film: Moses is kicked out of Egypt when Pharaoh realizes Moses is a Hebrew. Moses does appear to kill an Egyptian soldier, but that was in retaliation for the soldier calling Moses a slave. It was not Moses defending an oppressed brother or sister.4. The Bible: The Pharaoh is unnamed.The Film: The setting is the reign of Ramses. Hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves are portrayed in the movie, but the actual population of all slaves and of Hebrew slaves is unknown. Scott appears to try to bring the historical setting of the time to life, but the reality is that the \u201chistorical\u201d Exodus story is hard to pin down. \u201cThere is a deliberate lack of specification [in the Bible],\u201d explains Ellen Davis, professor of Bible and practical theology at Duke Divinity School. \u201cPharaoh is the sort of quintessential oppressive ruler in the Bible, and that is how he is remembered in later literature, so he stands for the oppressor of the moment in a sense.\u201d",

        "text": "A speculative comment on an online article has theorised how Boris Johnson was passed a poisoned chalice by Eton buddy David Cameron the morning after the referendum, and that Brexit may never happen.If true, it reveals a brilliant act of political manoeuvring that saves Cameron from forever being remembered as the bungling UK Prime Minister that blew it for Britain.A Brexit conspiracy theory finds Boris Johnson in a very tricky position. Source: AAPBut more likely it\u2019s a statement of how many grieving Brits have moved into the denial phase.Cutting through the weekend's deluge of media analysis and bloodletting, an astute comment made by \"Teebs\" on The Guardian website has been picked up by the likes of The Washington Post, The Independent.Teebs' theory may have thrown a lifeline to the 48 percent of desperate Britons who have spent the weekend finding solace in empty pint glasses and hiding under duvets from a future they don't care for.In short, what Teebs wrote goes something like this:Throughout the Brexit campaign, Cameron consistently claimed if Leave won he would invoke Article 50 (basically the UK handing in two years of notice to the EU they are leaving) straight away.Instead, as Cameron tended his resignation the morning after Remain had been defeated, the PM, who choked up near the end of his speech, said he'd be leaving it up to the new PM to trigger article 50.Media across Britain commented how deflated and downbeat Boris Johnson had appeared during his 'victory speech' after the country awoke to the cost of Brexit. Source: AAPThe very next day, The Sun splashed a story on its front page, revealing Cameron had conversed with aides before he quit, saying: ' Why should I have to do the hard sh-- for someone else, just to hand it over to them on a plate?'Pushing the button would instead be left to Johnson, should he become the next PM. It was widely noted Johnson appeared downbeat, like a King who had won a bloody and costly war, as he fronted media on the steps of his Islington home after the Cameron announcement.Johnson would be the one responsible for making the decision to take the kingdom into potentially decades of financial pain, uncertainty and division. The charge ahead would spell political doom for Johnson.The other option? Given that the referendum was only advisory and never legally bound parliament to act Johnson could delay and ultimately never invoke article 50, also committing political suicide.Teebs claimed a Brexit is \"an irreversible step\" Johnson is not prepared to take.\"All that remains is for someone to have the guts to stand up and say that Brexit is unachievable in reality without an enormous amount of pain and destruction, that cannot be borne,\" continued Teebs.Brussels says Brexit must happen quickly \u2013 however painful it must be. Boris Johnson is widely tipped as the man who will become the next UK Prime Minister. Source: AAP\"And David Cameron has put the onus of making that statement on the heads of the people who led the Brexit campaign.\"Seeking to avoid said pain and destruction, an online petition raged against the referendum and demanded a Brexit re-run, quickly clocking up millions of signatures.But all was not as it seemed. Hackers from 4 Chan claimed responsibility for hijacking the petition, which helped explained the inexplicable reason 39,411 residents of the Vatican City (true population 800) had signed, and why 23,778 concerned citizens of North Korea put their digital stamp on the document.As of this morning, some 77,000 fake signatures have been removed by Westminster, The Telegraph reports.The online petition actually carries little weight, other than to force more debate in the House of Commons, Dr Ben Wellings, Deputy Director of Monash University European and EU Centre, told ninemsn.Dr Wellings is positive Johnson will be the next UK PM, and he is equally sure article 50 will inevitably be invoked, despite the fear and immediate push back from a large chunk of the electorate.\"Parliament could ignore this but the consequence of that would be atomic,\" said Dr Wellings.\"The worrying thing about the online petition is that it means people don\u2019t accept the legitimacy of the process.\"Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, a proud Europhile, called for caution in a television interview over the weekend, where he refused to rule out a second referendum, however unlikely.Blair labelled the decision to leave the EU as \"a very serious mistake\".A massive depreciation of the pound, impending job losses and political turmoil were the new reality, said Blair.\"It's not in the interests of Europe or Britain to rush this; we're dealing with vast consequences for our economy, for our politics, for our security, and we've got to take this very carefully.\"This is going to be an agonising and highly complicated process.\"Quickly jostling for political position over the weekend were the Liberal Democrats, who pledged to fight the next election on a promise to keep Britain in the EU.A Sunday Times poll showed a surge in support for Scotland to declare independence from the UK and remain with the EU, in line with strong Remain support in the Brexit vote across Scottish electorates.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has claimed another referendum to break away and stay with the continent is \"highly likely\".She said Scotland would do whatever it takes to remain in the EU.Dr Wellings told ninemsn it was certainly possible Scotland could eject from the UK but the city of London could not \u2013 despite reactive petitions and clamouring from Londoners for new mayor Sadiq Khan to declare independence and stay with the EU.What is clear in all the fog is that there was no Brexit plan, said Dr Wellings.He believed Johnson never truly thought Leave would win a Brexit battle; rather he could lead a popular cause nobly and position himself to take the keys to Number 10 at the next UK general election in 2020.David Cameron, who at one time hoped Boris would pledge his allegiance to the Remain campaign, has now escalated that plan in a most Machiavellian way.",

        "text": "Earlier this month, clothing manufacturer and retailer American Apparel, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.American Apparel is a vertically integrated company, which means that it designs, manufactures, sells to other retailers and sells directly to consumers. All of its products are designed, produced and distributed from three facilities that are located within a 30-mile radius of Los Angeles. Its styles are, according to the company, \u201ciconic,\u201d \u201cclean,\u201d \u201csimple\u201d and \u201ctimeless.\u201d They are offered in a wide variety of colors, at \u201creasonable prices.\u201dFor years, this model worked.However, style preferences among young consumers have changed, along with their spending patterns since the Great Recession. Today it\u2019s unclear whether or not American Apparel\u2019s model can continue to provide an advantage over competitors in the marketplace.Legal issues notwithstanding, questions have arisen about whether or not American Apparel can survive, and whether it can do so if it continues to produce its garments in the U.S.As someone who studies fashion retailers, American Apparel will need to either move production offshore or automate production \u2014 perhaps even use cutting-edge robotics \u2014 if it ever hopes to prosper again.American Apparel is unique for two main reasons: Since its inception in 1989, it has been positioned as an environmentally and socially responsible operation. It\u2019s also a domestic producer \u2014 a rarity among major U.S. clothing lines \u2014 that sells in both the wholesale and retail sectors.Yet American Apparel faces intense competition in both its wholesale and retail operations. (According to its 2014 annual report, retail generates over two-thirds of net sales for American Apparel.)The retail sector for clothing \u2014 particularly classic apparel items for young adults such as those sold by American Apparel \u2014 is very crowded, with competitors like Gap GPS and Old Navy, J Crew, Urban Outfitters URBN and Uniqlo. Economists might even say that perfect competition exists. Because the products offered are so similar, you could argue competition is based solely on price.Yet branded retailers hope to avoid competing on price by creating a unique brand image, one that creates the impression that the products are different in a way that is meaningful to different groups of customers who are willing to pay for that unique difference. For example, a brand may entice shoppers who aspire to a luxurious lifestyle.In the case of American Apparel, they try to attract they type of hipster who might be interested in creating a unique look by buying vintage clothing at secondhand stores. Through creating a difference in the minds of shoppers, imperfect competition is actually ruling the market in this sector. And this moves competition away from price.The recent poor financial results of numerous retailers in the sector suggest, however, that the brand image of these iconic youth-focused apparel firms is no longer powerful enough to convince young shoppers to pay premium prices for these products.Rather than simply rely on its brand, American Apparel will need to carefully assess its products relative to competing retailers, so that the company can produce garments that are unique in a way that customers will truly value. This is absolutely essential because American Apparel\u2019s price is higher than its retail competitors. Fit, fiber content, style, color and product quality are known to be important to consumers. And there is also a segment of shoppers that values country of production.Meanwhile, the wholesale situation \u2014 the arm of American Apparel that produces goods to sell to retailers \u2014 is quite different. Here, American Apparel is in competition with a few very large corporations: Gildan Activewear GIL , HanesBrands HBI , Russell Athletic and Fruit of the Loom.All of these corporations produce offshore and have very small retail footprints, so American Apparel is facing something akin to an oligopoly: The large firms have the financial wherewithal to compete on price to drive out smaller competitors.One of the unique and popular aspects of American Apparel\u2019s basic merchandise selection is that the company\u2019s color variety is very large, with a mix of both basic and trendy fashion colors. This mix puts American Apparel into direct competition with the traditional knitwear producers who have much lower labor costs, because they produce offshore. But American Apparel pays labor costs of $12 to $14 per hour in Los Angeles, compared to companies that pay $2 in Vietnam, about $2.75 in Thailand and over $3 in China.Similar to its competitors in both the wholesale and retail sectors, American Apparel sells apparel for men, women and children, which implies that it\u2019s a family brand.However, the company describes its advertising as provocative, perhaps as a way to differentiate itself. Some have described the company\u2019s advertising as soft porn, due to the use of nudity and overly suggestive poses of the featured models.But why would a company that uses provocative advertising sell products for children?The promotional strategy seems misaligned with the target customer. So it will be important for American Apparel to assess the product lines offered relative to the brand image of the company.The risks of fast fashionThe company notes in the 2014 annual report that while they will attempt to streamline the number of styles offered in order to ensure they are able to stock basic items, they will also add new, fashionable items to respond quickly to changes in fashion.This move needs to be executed extremely carefully, as it puts them into more direct competition with the fast fashion retailers, such as H&M and Forever 21, that are known for their fashionable items and low prices.Will the new styles be sufficiently different from competitors to justify the higher prices, necessitated by domestic production? Also, the addition of more styles (and multiple colors in the usual mix of sizes) is expensive to maintain, while increasing the risk that popular items will go out of stock. Both of these issues tend to decrease margins.So what can be done?In the end, \u201cthe made-in-America\u201d aspect \u2014 so central to the brand\u2019s identity \u2014 is a critical factor that must be reconsidered. Based on its founding principles of social and environmental responsibility, the company employs domestic workers for the manual production of garments. It makes all its goods from one location, which also reduces the company\u2019s environmental footprint.However, labor is the highest cost component in the production of a garment. As the U.S. economy approaches full employment, domestic labor costs will only increase, making this style of production untenable.Should American Apparel go offshore, or could it mechanize its production?Fabric is not stiff enough to run through machinery without assistance from human fingers, so apparel production continues to be labor intensive. However, new technology could offer a solution. Robotics with complex sensors are being used to create \u201csew-bots\u201d that will decrease the need for manual labor.One disadvantage of this new technology is that it will reduce the number of sewing jobs. However, the technology will increase the need for workers with more advanced technical skills \u2014 employees who can program and maintain the machinery. Perhaps partnering with technology entrepreneurs to automate apparel production is the key to American Apparel\u2019s longevity in the marketplace.Because if production moves offshore, would the name American Apparel even make sense for the brand?Leslie Stoel is a professor of marketing at Miami University.

        "text": "Playboy's first non-nude issue has been on sale for the past month, and the media empire claims its re-robed strategy is working with advertisers.The 63-year-old magazine's March issue featured 42 advertising pages, which is a 55.5 percent increase from the same issue last year. In addition, 1,200 more newsstands carried the issue, and Playboy claims it's selling well. About 75 percent of the stock has sold out at Barnes & Noble.\"What we were experiencing (before the switch) is we would get in a lot of proposals from consumer-facing brands for huge digital ad buys, then there would be hesitancy before we could actually close the insertion order,\" said Playboy CEO Scott Flanders. \"Now we're getting requests for proposals asking us for ideas.\"In fact, the company claims that ever since it announced the new direction in October, it has held more than 300 meetings with new and existing advertisers. Print advertisers in the March issue include brands such as Stolichnaya Premium Vodka, which has been an advertiser since the 1980s, and Dodge, which was the magazine's first Detroit-based auto advertiser in 25 years. Dodge also was a sponsor Playboy's Super Bowl party in San Francisco this year.Meanwhile, Flanders said the safe-for-work strategy, which it has been employing on Playboy.com since August 2014, has led to a 400 percent growth in its online audience. It now gets 16 million unique global visitors per month, and 31 million users across its social media platforms. More importantly, the median age of visitors dropped from 47 to a much more advertiser desirable 30.5 during the same period.As a result of its larger footprint, Flanders said Playboy's digital ad revenue is up 75 percent compared to the first quarter of 2015. Todd Alchin, partner and chief creative strategist at media buying and planning agency Noble People, agreed that Playboy's strong name recognition still gives it a leg up, and jokes aside, the magazine has always had a commitment to journalistic articles.But Alchin pointed out that it faces challenges because of the decline of the publishing business overall. The non-nude announcement may have driven up publicity, causing a flood of new advertisers. However, that attention may not last.In addition, Alchin said that while it is true that companies are more comfortable with safe-for-work brands, the idea of them shying away from adult titles is starting to fade. Just recently, clothing brand Diesel ran a huge ad campaign on the porn website, Pornhub.\"I don't doubt the (Playboy) numbers,\" said Alchin. \"I just doubt the longevity of it. I don't want to suggest they can't build a solid product without nudity. I just think it's too early to make that call.\"Still, Playboy's Flanders insists that becoming safe for work has also helped with licensing, which has always been a non-nude part of the business. Its largest licensee skin and body care company Coty \u2014 which does almost $200 million in wholesale Playboy-licensed item business annually \u2014 is considering a return to the U.S. market. It is also launching its second seasonal collaboration with clothing brand Joyrich.It's hard to deny the print magazine's declining circulation rates. Per the company, in March of last year it had 750,000 subscribers. This past March, it was just 500,000. In the mid-1970s, Playboy had circulation of about six million.Playboy did add that it reset its ad rate base numbers \u2014 the figure used to compute the price per ad \u2014 in 2016 in order to eliminate subscribers that are getting free issues or not paying the full rate, which is often included in other magazine's circulation numbers. If those people are included, the numbers would be around 600,000. The publication are hopeful that the figures will increase again with the more safe-for-work issues.\"The massive press attention to move to non-nude (in the print edition) has garnered almost 7 billion media impressions,\" said Flanders. \"It remains our 5th Avenue storefront, and there is a credibility. Our contributors feel they want to be in print. We continue to draw luminaries for that, I'm not sure we would receive the same attention for important influencers without the print product.\"The declining numbers are an issue that most men's print magazines are facing. FHM and Details folded last year. Maxim also cut its ad rate base to 900,000 from 2 million in October.Flanders dismissed the worrisome category, saying that because of Playboy's strong brand name and large digital audience, it considers its place in the media landscape to be more in line with Buzzfeed and Vice.Read More: Playboy Selects Pamela Anderson to be Final Nude Centerfold",
